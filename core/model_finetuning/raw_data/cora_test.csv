"Title: Independent Component Analysis by General Non-linear Hebbian-like Learning Rules  
Abstract: A number of neural learning rules have been recently proposed for Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The rules are usually derived from information-theoretic criteria such as maximum entropy or minimum mutual information. In this paper, we show that in fact, ICA can be performed by very simple Hebbian or anti-Hebbian learning rules, which may have only weak relations to such information-theoretical quantities. Rather suprisingly, practically any non-linear function can be used in the learning rule, provided only that the sign of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian term is chosen correctly. In addition to the Hebbian-like mechanism, the weight vector is here constrained to have unit norm, and the data is preprocessed by prewhitening, or sphering. These results imply that one can choose the non-linearity so as to optimize desired statistical or numerical criteria.","Title: A FAMILY OF FIXED-POINT ALGORITHMS FOR INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS  
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical signal processing technique whose main applications are blind source separation, blind deconvolution, and feature extraction. Estimation of ICA is usually performed by optimizing a 'contrast' function based on higher-order cumulants. In this paper, it is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for tnding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a txed-point iteration scheme is then introduced. The resulting algorithms are quite simple and converge fast and reliably. These algorithms also enable estimation of the independent components one-by-one, using a simple deation scheme. ",1
"Title: Why Ants are Hard genetic programming, simulated annealing and hill climbing performance is shown not
Abstract: The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used as an example program search space. Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for Genetic Algorithms. Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat. ","Title: The Evolution of Size in Variable Length Representations  
Abstract: In many cases programs length's increase (known as bloat, fluff and increasing structural complexity) during artificial evolution. We show bloat is not specific to genetic programming and suggest it is inherent in search techniques with discrete variable length representations using simple static evaluation functions. We investigate the bloating characteristics of three non-population and one population based search techniques using a novel mutation operator. An artificial ant following the Santa Fe trail problem is solved by simulated annealing, hill climbing, strict hill climbing and population based search using two variants of the the new subtree based mutation operator. As predicted bloat is observed when using unbiased mutation and is absent in simulated annealing and both hill climbers when using the length neutral mutation however bloat occurs with both mutations when using a population. We conclude that there are two causes of bloat 1) search operators with no length bias tend to sample bigger trees and 2) competition within populations favours longer programs as they can usually reproduce more accurately.

"Title: Adaptive state space quantisation for reinforcement learning of collision-free navigation  
Abstract: The paper describes a self-learning control system for a mobile robot. Based on sensor information the control system has to provide a steering signal in such a way that collisions are avoided. Since in our case no `examples' are available, the system learns on the basis of an external reinforcement signal which is negative in case of a collision and zero otherwise. Rules from Temporal Difference learning are used to find the correct mapping between the (discrete) sensor input space and the steering signal. We describe the algorithm for learning the correct mapping from the input (state) vector to the output (steering) signal, and the algorithm which is used for a discrete coding of the input state space.

"Title: Using Sampling and Queries to Extract Rules from Trained Neural Networks  
Abstract: Concepts learned by neural networks are difficult to understand because they are represented using large assemblages of real-valued parameters. One approach to understanding trained neural networks is to extract symbolic rules that describe their classification behavior. There are several existing rule-extraction approaches that operate by searching for such rules. We present a novel method that casts rule extraction not as a search problem, but instead as a learning problem. In addition to learning from training examples, our method exploits the property that networks can be efficiently queried. We describe algorithms for extracting both conjunctive and M -of-N rules, and present experiments that show that our method is more efficient than conventional search-based approaches.","Title: Extracting Provably Correct Rules from Artificial Neural Networks  
Abstract: Although connectionist learning procedures have been applied successfully to a variety of real-world scenarios, artificial neural networks have often been criticized for exhibiting a low degree of comprehensibility. Mechanisms that automatically compile neural networks into symbolic rules offer a promising perspective to overcome this practical shortcoming of neural network representations. This paper describes an approach to neural network rule extraction based on Validity Interval Analysis (VI-Analysis). VI-Analysis is a generic tool for extracting symbolic knowledge from Backpropagation-style artificial neural networks. It does this by propagating whole intervals of activations through the network in both the forward and backward directions. In the context of rule extraction, these intervals are used to prove or disprove the correctness of conjectured rules. We describe techniques for generating and testing rule hypotheses, and demonstrate these using some simple classification tasks including the MONK's benchmark problems. Rules extracted by VI-Analysis are provably correct. No assumptions are made about the topology of the network at hand, as well as the procedure employed for training the network. ",1
"Title: Inference in Model-Based Cluster Analysis  
Abstract: Technical Report no. 285 Department of Statistics University of Washington. March 10, 1995 ","Title: How Many Clusters? Which Clustering Method? Answers Via Model-Based Cluster Analysis 1  
Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.",1

Abstract: 1 This report is also available through http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~gusz/ sawvsgga.ps.gz ","Title: Evaluating and Improving Steady State Evolutionary Algorithms on Constraint Satisfaction Problems  
Abstract: The work in progress reported by Wright & Liley shows great promise, primarily because of their experimental and simulation paradigms. However, their tentative conclusion that macroscopic neocortex may be considered (approximately) a linear near-equilibrium system is premature and does not correspond to tentative conclusions drawn from other studies of neocortex. At this time, there exists an interdisciplinary multidimensional gradation on published studies of neocortex, with one primary dimension of mathematical physics represented by two extremes. At one extreme, there is much scientifically unsupported talk of chaos and quantum physics being responsible for many important macroscopic neocortical processes (involving many thousands to millions of neurons) (Wilczek, 1994). At another extreme, many non-mathematically trained neuroscientists uncritically lump all neocortical mathematical theory into one file, and consider only statistical averages of citations for opinions on the quality of that research (Nunez, 1995). In this context, it is important to appreciate that Wright and Liley (W&L) report on their scientifically sound studies on macroscopic neocortical function, based on simulation and a blend of sound theory and reproducible experiments. However, their pioneering work, given the absence of much knowledge of neocortex at this time, is open to criticism, especially with respect to their present inferences and conclusions. Their conclusion that EEG data exhibit linear near-equilibrium dynamics may very well be true, but only in the sense of focusing only on one local minima, possibly with individual-specific and physiological-state dependent ",1
"Title: Distributed Collective Adaptation Applied to a Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problem  
Abstract: We utilize collective memory to integrate weak and strong search heuristics to find cliques in FC, a family of graphs. We construct FC such that pruning of partial solutions will be ineffective. Each weak heuristic maintains a local cache of the collective memory. We examine the impact on the distributed search from the various characteristics of the distribution of the collective memory, the search algorithms, and our family of graphs. We find the distributed search performs better than the individuals, even though the space of partial solutions is combinatorially explosive. ","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: Learning Probabilistic Automata with Variable Memory Length  
Abstract: We propose and analyze a distribution learning algorithm for variable memory length Markov processes. These processes can be described by a subclass of probabilistic finite automata which we name Probabilistic Finite Suffix Automata. The learning algorithm is motivated by real applications in man-machine interaction such as handwriting and speech recognition. Conventionally used fixed memory Markov and hidden Markov models have either severe practical or theoretical drawbacks. Though general hardness results are known for learning distributions generated by sources with similar structure, we prove that our algorithm can indeed efficiently learn distributions generated by our more restricted sources. In Particular, we show that the KL-divergence between the distribution generated by the target source and the distribution generated by our hypothesis can be made small with high confidence in polynomial time and sample complexity. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by learning the structure of natural English text and using our hy pothesis for the correction of corrupted text.","Title: Learning Markov chains with variable memory length from noisy output  
Abstract: The problem of modeling complicated data sequences, such as DNA or speech, often arises in practice. Most of the algorithms select a hypothesis from within a model class assuming that the observed sequence is the direct output of the underlying generation process. In this paper we consider the case when the output passes through a memoryless noisy channel before observation. In particular, we show that in the class of Markov chains with variable memory length, learning is affected by factors, which, despite being super-polynomial, are still small in some practical cases. Markov models with variable memory length, or probabilistic finite suffix automata, were introduced in learning theory by Ron, Singer and Tishby who also described a polynomial time learning algorithm [11, 12]. We present a modification of the algorithm which uses a noise-corrupted sample and has knowledge of the noise structure. The same algorithm is still viable if the noise is not known exactly but a good estimation is available. Finally, some experimental results are presented for removing noise from corrupted English text, and to measure how the performance of the learning algorithm is affected by the size of the noisy sample and the noise rate.

"Title: On the Informativeness of the DNA Promoter Sequences Domain Theory  
Abstract: The DNA promoter sequences domain theory and database have become popular for testing systems that integrate empirical and analytical learning. This note reports a simple change and reinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of M-of-N concepts, involving no learning, that results in an accuracy of 93.4% on the 106 items of the database. Moreover, an exhaustive search of the space of M-of-N domain theory interpretations indicates that the expected accuracy of a randomly chosen interpretation is 76.5%, and that a maximum accuracy of 97.2% is achieved in 12 cases. This demonstrates the informativeness of the domain theory, without the complications of understanding the interactions between various learning algorithms and the theory. In addition, our results help characterize the difficulty of learning using the DNA promoters theory.","Title: Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories  
Abstract: The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies.

The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``ow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair awed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.",1

Abstract: Two recently implemented machine learning algorithms, RIPPER and sleeping experts for phrases, are evaluated on a number of large text categorization problems. These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the ""context"" of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information. ",1

"Title: Learning Hierarchical Control Structures for Multiple Tasks and Changing Environments  
Abstract: While the need for hierarchies within control systems is apparent, it is also clear to many researchers that such hierarchies should be learned. Learning both the structure and the component behaviors is a difficult task. The benefit of learning the hierarchical structures of behaviors is that the decomposition of the control structure into smaller transportable chunks allows previously learned knowledge to be applied to new but related tasks. Presented in this paper are improvements to Nested Q-learning (NQL) that allow more realistic learning of control hierarchies in reinforcement environments. Also presented is a simulation of a simple robot performing a series of related tasks that is used to compare both hierarchical and non-hierarchal learning techniques.

Abstract: Much has been done to develop learning techniques for delayed reward problems in worlds where the actions and/or states are approximated by discrete representations. Although this is acceptable in some applications there are many more situations where such an approximation is difficult and unnatural. For instance, in applications such as robotic,s where real machines interact with the real world, learning techniques that use real valued continuous quantities are required. Presented in this paper is an extension to Q-learning that uses both real valued states and actions. This is achieved by introducing activation strengths to each actuator system of the robot. This allow all actuators to be active to some continuous amount simultaneously. Learning occurs by incrementally adapting both the expected future reward to goal evaluation function and the gradients of that function with respect to each actuator system. ",1

Abstract: We have constructed an inexpensive, video-based, motorized tracking system that learns to track a head. It uses real time graphical user inputs or an auxiliary infrared detector as supervisory signals to train a convolutional neural network. The inputs to the neural network consist of normalized luminance and chrominance images and motion information from frame differences. Subsampled images are also used to provide scale invariance. During the online training phase, the neural network rapidly adjusts the input weights depending upon the reliability of the different channels in the surrounding environment. This quick adaptation allows the system to robustly track a head even when other objects are moving within a cluttered background.","Title: Human Face Detection in Visual Scenes

We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.",1

"Title: MLC Tutorial A Machine Learning library of C classes.  
Abstract: Several evolutionary algorithms make use of hierarchical representations of variable size rather than linear strings of fixed length. Variable complexity of the structures provides an additional representational power which may widen the application domain of evolutionary algorithms. The price for this is, however, that the search space is open-ended and solutions may grow to arbitrarily large size. In this paper we study the effects of structural complexity of the solutions on their generalization performance by analyzing the fitness landscape of sigma-pi neural networks. The analysis suggests that smaller networks achieve, on average, better generalization accuracy than larger ones, thus confirming the usefulness of Occam's razor. A simple method for implementing the Occam's razor principle is described and shown to be effective in improv ing the generalization accuracy without limiting their learning capacity.","Title: Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem  
Abstract: We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.",1

MLC ++ not only provides a workbench for such comparisons, but also provides a library of C ++ classes to aid in the development of new algorithms, especially hybrid algorithms and multi-strategy algorithms. Such algorithms are generally hard to code from scratch. We discuss design issues, interfaces to other programs, and visualization of the resulting classifiers.

Abstract: We describe an experimental study of pruning methods for decision tree classifiers when the goal is minimizing loss rather than error. In addition to two common methods for error minimization, CART's cost-complexity pruning and C4.5's error-based pruning, we study the extension of cost-complexity pruning to loss and one pruning variant based on the Laplace correction. We perform an empirical comparison of these methods and evaluate them with respect to loss. We found that applying the Laplace correction to estimate the probability distributions at the leaves was beneficial to all pruning methods. Unlike in error minimization, and somewhat surprisingly, performing no pruning led to results that were on par with other methods in terms of the evaluation criteria. The main advantage of pruning was in the reduction of the decision tree size, sometimes by a factor of ten. While no method dominated others on all datasets, even for the same domain different pruning mechanisms are better for different loss matrices.",1
"Title: Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial-Memory Approach  Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory  
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning evolving concepts, that is, concepts whose meaning gradually evolves in time. Solving this problem is important to many applications, for example, building intelligent agents for helping users in Internet search, active vision, automatically updating knowledge-bases, or acquiring profiles of users of telecommunication networks. Requirements for a learning architecture supporting such applications include the ability to incrementally modify concept definitions to accommodate new information, fast learning and recognition rates, low memory needs, and the understandability of computer-created concept descriptions. To address these requirements, we propose a learning architecture based on Variable-Valued Logic, the Star Methodology, and the AQ algorithm. The method uses a partial-memory approach, which means that in each step of learning, the system remembers the current concept descriptions and specially selected representative examples from the past experience. The developed method has been experimentally applied to the problem of computer system intrusion detection. The results show significant advantages of the method in learning speed and memory requirements with only slight decreases in predictive accuracy and concept simplicity when compared to traditional batch-style learning in which all training examples are provided at once. ","Title: A Partial Memory Incremental Learning Methodology And Its Application To Computer Intrusion Detection  
Abstract: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of a single site in the somatosensory cortex of rats and monkeys for 2-6 hours produces a large increase in the number of neurons responsive to the skin region corresponding to the ICMS-site receptive field (RF), with very little effect on the position and size of the ICMS-site RF, and the response evoked at the ICMS site by tactile stimulation (Recanzone et al., 1992b). Large changes in RF topography are observed following several weeks of repetitive stimulation of a restricted skin region in monkeys (Jenkins et al., 1990; Recanzone et al., 1992acde). Repetitive stimulation of a localized skin region in monkeys produced by training the monkeys in a tactile frequency discrimination task improves their performance (Recanzone et al., 1992a). It has been suggested that these changes in RF topography are caused by competitive learning in excitatory pathways (Grajski & Merzenich, 1990; Jenkins et al., 1990; Recanzone et al., 1992abcde). ICMS almost simultaneously excites excitatory and inhibitory terminals and excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons within a few microns of the stimulating electrode. Thus, this paper investigates the implications of the possibility that lateral inhibitory pathways too may undergo synaptic plasticity during ICMS. Lateral inhibitory pathways may also undergo synaptic plasticity in adult animals during peripheral conditioning.

"Title: Cholinergic suppression of transmission may allow combined associative memory function and self-organization in the neocortex.  
Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.","Title: Monte Carlo Comparison of Non-hierarchical Unsupervised Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we further characterize the complexity of noise-tolerant learning in the PAC model. Specifically, we show a general lower bound of log(1=ffi) on the number of examples required for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise. Combined with a result of Simon, we effectively show that the sample complexity of PAC learning in the presence of classification noise is VC(F) ""(12) 2 : Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of the general lower bound by providing a noise-tolerant learning algorithm for the class of symmetric Boolean functions which uses a sample size within a constant factor of this bound. Finally, we note that our general lower bound compares favorably with various general upper bounds for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise. ",1
"Title: Extensions of Fill's algorithm for perfect simulation  
Abstract: Fill's algorithm for perfect simulation for attractive finite state space models, unbiased for user impatience, is presented in terms of stochastic recursive sequences and extended in two ways. Repulsive discrete Markov random fields with two coding sets like the auto-Poisson distribution on a lattice with 4-neighbourhood can be treated as monotone systems if a particular partial ordering and quasi-maximal and quasi-minimal states are used. Fill's algorithm then applies directly. Combining Fill's rejection sampling with sandwiching leads to a version of the algorithm, which works for general discrete conditionally specified repulsive models. Extensions to other types of models are briefly discussed. ","Title: EXACT SIMULATION USING MARKOV CHAINS  
Abstract: This reports gives a review of the new exact simulation algorithms using Markov chains. The first part covers the discrete case. We consider two different algorithms, Propp and Wilsons coupling from the past (CFTP) technique and Fills rejection sampler. The algorithms are tested on the Ising model, with and without an external field. The second part covers continuous state spaces. We present several algorithms developed by Murdoch and Green, all based on coupling from the past. We discuss the applicability of these methods on a Bayesian analysis problem of surgical failure rates. ",1
"Title: Accounting for Model Uncertainty in Survival Analysis Improves Predictive Performance  
Abstract: Survival analysis is concerned with finding models to predict the survival of patients or to assess the efficacy of a clinical treatment. A key part of the model-building process is the selection of the predictor variables. It is standard to use a stepwise procedure guided by a series of significance tests to select a single model, and then to make inference conditionally on the selected model. However, this ignores model uncertainty, which can be substantial. We review the standard Bayesian model averaging solution to this problem and extend it to survival analysis, introducing partial Bayes factors to do so for the Cox proportional hazards model. In two examples, taking account of model uncertainty enhances predictive performance, to an extent that could be clinically useful.","Title: Bayesian Graphical Models for Discrete Data

"Title: An Empirical Evaluation of Bagging and Boosting  
Abstract: An ensemble consists of a set of independently trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman 1996a) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithms. Our results clearly show two important facts. The first is that even though Bagging almost always produces a better classifier than any of its individual component classifiers and is relatively impervious to overfitting, it does not generalize any better than a baseline neural-network ensemble method. The second is that Boosting is a powerful technique that can usually produce better ensembles than Bagging; however, it is more susceptible to noise and can quickly overfit a data set. ","Title: Actively Searching for an Effective Neural-Network Ensemble  
Abstract: A neural-network ensemble is a very successful technique where the outputs of a set of separately trained neural network are combined to form one unified prediction. An effective ensemble should consist of a set of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well; however, most existing techniques only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set. We present an algorithm called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to explicitly search for a highly diverse set of accurate trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are highly accurate while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on four real-world domains show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing ensemble approaches. Experiments also show that Addemup is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble. ",1
"Title: Improving the Accuracy and Speed of Support Vector Machines  
Abstract: Support Vector Learning Machines (SVM) are finding application in pattern recognition, regression estimation, and operator inversion for ill-posed problems. Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the ""virtual support vector"" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the ""reduced set"" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1% error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances. The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine.

Abstract: Key ideas from statistical learning theory and support vector machines are generalized to decision trees. A support vector machine is used for each decision in the tree. The ""optimal"" decision tree is characterized, and both a primal and dual space formulation for constructing the tree are proposed. The result is a method for generating logically simple decision trees with multivariate linear or nonlinear decisions. The preliminary results indicate that the method produces simple trees that generalize well with respect to other decision tree algorithms and single support vector machines.",1
"Title: How to Use Expert Advice (Extended Abstract)  
Abstract: We analyze algorithms that predict a binary value by combining the predictions of several prediction strategies, called experts. Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We give implications of this result on the performance of batch learning algorithms in a PAC setting which improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes. ","Title: Using and combining predictors that specialize  
Abstract: We study online learning algorithms that predict by combining the predictions of several subordinate prediction algorithms, sometimes called experts. These simple algorithms belong to the multiplicative weights family of algorithms. The performance of these algorithms degrades only logarithmically with the number of experts, making them particularly useful in applications where the number of experts is very large. However, in applications such as text categorization, it is often natural for some of the experts to abstain from making predictions on some of the instances. We show how to transform algorithms that assume that all experts are always awake to algorithms that do not require this assumption. We also show how to derive corresponding loss bounds. Our method is very general, and can be applied to a large family of online learning algorithms. We also give applications to various prediction models including decision graphs and switching experts.

"Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Independent vs. Cooperative Agents  
Abstract: Intelligent human agents exist in a cooperative social environment that facilitates learning. They learn not only by trial-and-error, but also through cooperation by sharing instantaneous information, episodic experience, and learned knowledge. The key investigations of this paper are, ""Given the same number of reinforcement learning agents, will cooperative agents outperform independent agents who do not communicate during learning?"" and ""What is the price for such cooperation?"" Using independent agents as a benchmark, cooperative agents are studied in following ways: (1) sharing sensation, (2) sharing episodes, and (3) sharing learned policies. This paper shows that (a) additional sensation from another agent is beneficial if it can be used efficiently, (b) sharing learned policies or episodes among agents speeds up learning at the cost of communication, and (c) for joint tasks, agents engaging in partnership can significantly outperform independent agents although they may learn slowly in the beginning. These tradeoffs are not just limited to multi-agent reinforcement learning.","Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Theoretical Framework and an Algorithm

This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies.",1

Abstract: The CN2 algorithm induces an ordered list of classification rules from examples using entropy as its search heuristic. In this short paper, we describe two improvements to this algorithm. Firstly, we present the use of the Laplacian error estimate as an alternative evaluation function and secondly, we show how unordered as well as ordered rules can be generated. We experimentally demonstrate significantly improved performances resulting from these changes, thus enhancing the usefulness of CN2 as an inductive tool. Comparisons with Quinlan's C4.5 are also made. ","Title: Case-Based Sonogram Classification  
Abstract: This report replicates and extends results reported by Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) personnel on the automatic classification of sonar images. They used novel case-based reasoning systems in their empirical studies, but did not obtain comparative analyses using standard classification algorithms. Therefore, the quality of the NAWC results were unknown. We replicated the NAWC studies and also tested several other classifiers (i.e., both case-based and otherwise) from the machine learning literature. These comparisons and their ramifications are detailed in this paper. Next, we investigated Fala and Walker's two suggestions for future work (i.e., on combining their similarity functions and on an alternative case representation). Finally, we describe several ways to incorporate additional domain-specific knowledge when applying case-based classifiers to similar tasks. ",1
"Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms  
Abstract: There are now methods for organising a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation so that it can be guaranteed that the state of the process at a given time is exactly drawn from the target distribution. The question of assessing convergence totally vanishes. Such methods are known as exact or perfect sampling. The approach that has received most attention uses the protocol of coupling from the past devised by Propp and Wilson (Random Structures and Algorithms,1996), in which multiple dependent paths of the chain are run from different initial states at a sequence of initial times going backwards into the past, until they satisfy the condition of coalescence by time 0. When this is achieved the state at time 0 is distributed according to the required target. This process must be implemented very carefully to assure its validity (including appropriate re-use of random number streams), and also requires one of various tricks to enable us to follow infinitely many sample paths with a finite amount of work. With the ultimate objective of Bayesian MCMC with guaranteed convergence, the purpose of this paper is to describe recent efforts to construct exact sampling methods for continuous-state Markov chains. We review existing methods based on gamma-coupling and rejection sampling (Murdoch and Green, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 1998), that are quite straightforward to understand, but require a closed form for the transition kernel and entail cumbersome algebraic manipulation. We then introduce two new methods based on random walk Metropolis, that offer the prospect of more automatic use, not least because the difficult, continuous, part of the transition mechanism can be coupled in a generic way, using a proposal distribution of convenience. One of the methods is based on a neat decomposition of any unimodal (multivariate) symmetric density into pieces that may be re-assembled to construct any translated copy of itself: that allows coupling of a continuum of Metropolis proposals to a finite set, at least for a compact state space. We discuss methods for economically coupling the subsequent accept/reject decisions. Our second new method deals with unbounded state spaces, using a trick due to W. S. Kendall of running a coupled dominating process in parallel with the sample paths of interest. The random subset of the state space below the dominating path is compact, allowing efficient coupling and coalescence. We look towards the possibility that application of such methods could become sufficiently convenient that they could become the basis for routine Bayesian computation in the foreseeable future.

Abstract: A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical dependency among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm is verified by computer simulations. ",1
"Title: Sequence Learning with Incremental Higher-Order Neural Networks  
Abstract: An incremental, higher-order, non-recurrent neural-network combines two properties found to be useful for sequence learning in neural-networks: higher-order connections and the incremental introduction of new units. The incremental, higher-order neural-network adds higher orders when needed by adding new units that dynamically modify connection weights. The new units modify the weights at the next time-step with information from the previous step. Since a theoretically unlimited number of units can be added to the network, information from the arbitrarily distant past can be brought to bear on each prediction. Temporal tasks can thereby be learned without the use of feedback, in contrast to recurrent neural-networks. Because there are no recurrent connections, training is simple and fast. Experiments have demonstrated speedups of two orders of magnitude over recurrent networks.","Title: Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure  
Abstract: Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because only a fraction of the relevant information is available at any instant. Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time|e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase|but not structure that occurs over longer time periods|e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard Many patterns in the world are intrinsically temporal, e.g., speech, music, the unfolding of events. Recurrent neural net architectures have been devised to accommodate time-varying sequences. For example, the architecture shown in Figure 1 can map a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs. Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because the input pattern may not contain all the task-relevant information at any instant. Thus, back propagation.",1
"Title: TD Learning of Game Evaluation Functions with Hierarchical Neural Architectures  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been used to solve hard optimization problems ranging from the Travelling Salesman problem to the Quadratic Assignment problem. We show that the Simple Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve an optimization problem derived from the 3-Conjunctive Normal Form problem. By separating the populations into small sub-populations, parallel genetic algorithms exploits the inherent parallelism in genetic algorithms and prevents premature convergence. Genetic algorithms using hill-climbing conduct genetic search in the space of local optima, and hill-climbing can be less com-putationally expensive than genetic search. We examine the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the quality of solutions of 3CNF problems. ","Title: Machine Learning Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences Keywords: Incremental learning, prediction,
Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",1
"Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees. Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity.

Abstract: A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form. We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical approaches.",1

Abstract: In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalization of reinforcement learning, a single adaptive agent interacts with an environment defined by a probabilistic transition function.

The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals. This paper considers a step in this direction in which exactly two agents with diametrically opposed goals share an environment. It describes a Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimal policies and demonstrates its application to a simple two-player game in which the optimal policy is probabilistic.",1

Abstract: Reinforcement learning techniques address the problem of learning to select actions in unknown, dynamic environments. It is widely acknowledged that to be of use in complex domains, reinforcement learning techniques must be combined with generalizing function approximation methods such as artificial neural networks. Little, however, is understood about the theoretical properties of such combinations, and many researchers have encountered failures in practice. In this paper we identify a prime source of such failuresnamely, a systematic overestimation of utility values. Using Watkins' Q-Learning [18] as an example, we give a theoretical account of the phenomenon, deriving conditions under which one may expected it to cause learning to fail. Employing some of the most popular function approximators, we present experimental results which support the theoretical findings.

"Title: Quantifying Prior Determination Knowledge using the PAC Learning Model  
Abstract: Prior knowledge, or bias, regarding a concept can speed up the task of learning it. Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning is a mathematical model of concept learning that can be used to quantify the speed up due to different forms of bias on learning. Thus far, PAC learning has mostly been used to analyze syntactic bias, such as limiting concepts to conjunctions of boolean prepositions. This paper demonstrates that PAC learning can also be used to analyze semantic bias, such as a domain theory about the concept being learned. The key idea is to view the hypothesis space in PAC learning as that consistent with all prior knowledge, syntactic and semantic. In particular, the paper presents a PAC analysis of determinations, a type of relevance knowledge. The results of the analysis reveal crisp distinctions and relations among different determinations, and illustrate the usefulness of an analysis based on the PAC model.

Abstract: Performance of human subjects in a wide variety of early visual processing tasks improves with practice. HyperBF networks (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) constitute a mathematically well-founded framework for understanding such improvement in performance, or perceptual learning, in the class of tasks known as visual hyperacuity. The present article concentrates on two issues raised by the recent psychophysical and computational findings reported in (Poggio et al., 1992b; Fahle and Edelman, 1992). First, we develop a biologically plausible extension of the HyperBF model that takes into account basic features of the functional architecture of early vision. Second, we explore various learning modes that can coexist within the HyperBF framework and focus on two unsupervised learning rules which may be involved in hyperacuity learning. Finally, we report results of psychophysical experiments that are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent presynaptic amplification may be involved in perceptual learning in hyperacuity.

"Title: Multipath Execution: Opportunities and Limits  
Abstract: Even sophisticated branch-prediction techniques necessarily suffer some mispredictions, and even relatively small mispredict rates hurt performance substantially in current-generation processors. In this paper, we investigate schemes for improving performance in the face of imperfect branch predictors by having the processor simultaneously execute code from both the taken and not-taken outcomes of a branch. This paper presents data regarding the limits of multipath execution, considers fetch-bandwidth needs for multipath execution, and discusses various dynamic confidence-prediction schemes that gauge the likelihood of branch mispredictions. Our evaluations consider executing along several (28) paths at once. Using 4 paths and a relatively simple confidence predictor, multipath execution garners speedups of up to 30% compared to the single-path case, with an average speedup of 14.4% for the SPECint suite. While associated increases in instruction-fetch-bandwidth requirements are not too surprising, a less expected result is the significance of having a separate return-address stack for each forked path. Overall, our results indicate that multipath execution offers significant improvements over single-path performance, and could be especially useful when combined with multithreading so that hardware costs can be amortized over both approaches. ","Title: Threaded Multiple Path Execution  
Abstract: This paper presents Threaded Multi-Path Execution (TME), which exploits existing hardware on a Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) processor to speculatively execute multiple paths of execution. When there are fewer threads in an SMT processor than hardware contexts, threaded multi-path execution uses spare contexts to fetch and execute code along the less likely path of hard-to-predict branches. This paper describes the hardware mechanisms needed to enable an SMT processor to efficiently spawn speculative threads for threaded multi-path execution. The Mapping Synchronization Bus is described, which enables the spawning of these multiple paths. Policies are examined for deciding which branches to fork, and for managing competition between primary and alternate path threads for critical resources. Our results show that TME increases the single program performance of an SMT with eight thread contexts by 14%-23% on average, depending on the misprediction penalty, for programs with a high misprediction rate.

"Title: Strategy Learning with Multilayer Connectionist Representations 1  
Abstract: Results are presented that demonstrate the learning and fine-tuning of search strategies using connectionist mechanisms. Previous studies of strategy learning within the symbolic, production-rule formalism have not addressed fine-tuning behavior. Here a two-layer connectionist system is presented that develops its search from a weak to a task-specific strategy and fine-tunes its performance. The system is applied to a simulated, real-time, balance-control task. We compare the performance of one-layer and two-layer networks, showing that the ability of the two-layer network to discover new features and thus enhance the original representation is critical to solving the balancing task. ","Title: Learning to Race: Experiments with a Simulated Race Car  
Abstract: We have implemented a reinforcement learning architecture as the reactive component of a two layer control system for a simulated race car. We have found that separating the layers has expedited gradually improving competition and mult-agent interaction. We ran experiments to test the tuning, decomposition and coordination of the low level behaviors. We then extended our control system to allow passing of other cars and tested its ability to avoid collisions. The best design used reinforcement learning with separate networks for each behavior, coarse coded input and a simple rule based coordination mechanism. ",1
"Title: Genetic Programming and Data Structures  
Abstract: We attempt to recover an unknown function from noisy, sampled data. Using orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets we develop a nonlinear method which works in the wavelet domain by simple nonlinear shrinkage of the empirical wavelet coefficients. The shrinkage can be tuned to be nearly minimax over any member of a wide range of Triebel- and Besov-type smoothness constraints, and asymptotically minimax over Besov bodies with p q. Linear estimates cannot achieve even the minimax rates over Triebel and Besov classes with p &lt; 2, so our method can significantly outperform every linear method (kernel, smoothing spline, sieve, : : : ) in a minimax sense. Variants of our method based on simple threshold nonlinearities are nearly minimax. Our method possesses the interpretation of spatial adaptivity: it reconstructs using a kernel which may vary in shape and bandwidth from point to point, depending on the data. Least favorable distributions for certain of the Triebel and Besov scales generate objects with sparse wavelet transforms. Many real objects have similarly sparse transforms, which suggests that these minimax results are relevant for practical problems. Sequels to this paper discuss practical implementation, spatial adaptation properties and applications to inverse problems. Acknowledgements.

Abstract: In real world applications, software engineers recognise the use of memory must be organised via data structures and that software using the data must be independant of the data structures' implementation details. They achieve this by using abstract data structures, such as records, files and buffers. We demonstrate that genetic programming can automatically implement simple abstract data structures, considering in detail the task of evolving a list. We show general and reasonably efficient implementations can be automatically generated from simple primitives. A model for maintaining evolved code is demonstrated using the list problem. Much published work on genetic programming (GP) evolves functions without side-effects to learn patterns in test data. In contrast human written programs often make extensive and explicit use of memory. Indeed memory in some form is required for a programming system to be Turing Complete, i.e. for it to be possible to write any (computable) program in that system. However inclusion of memory can make the interactions between parts of programs much more complex and so make it harder to produce programs. Despite this it has been shown GP can automatically create programs which explicitly use memory [Teller 1994]. In both normal and genetic programming considerable benefits have been found in adopting a structured approach. For example [Koza 1994] shows the introduction of evolvable code modules (automatically defined functions, ADFs) can greatly help GP to reach a solution. We suggest that a corresponding structured approach to use of data will similarly have significant advantage to GP. Earlier work has demonstrated that genetic programming can automatically generate simple abstract data structures, namely stacks and queues [Langdon 1995a]. That is, GP can evolve programs that organise memory (accessed via simple read and write primitives) into data structures which can be used by external software without it needing to know how they are implemented. This chapter shows it is possible to evolve a list data structure from basic primitives. [Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman 1987] suggest three different ways to implement a list but these experiments show GP can evolve its own implementation. This requires all the list components to agree on one implementation as they co-evolve together. Section 20.3 describes the GP architecture, including use of Pareto multiple component fitness scoring (20.3.4) and measures aimed at speeding the GP search (20.3.5). The evolved solutions are described in Section 20.4. Section 20.5 presents a candidate model for maintaining evolved software. This is followed by a discussion of what we have learned (20.6) and conclusions that can be drawn (20.7). ",1
"Title: Application of statistical mechanics methodol- ogy to term-structure bond-pricing models, Mathl. Comput. Modelling Application of
Abstract: The work in progress reported by Wright & Liley shows great promise, primarily because of their experimental and simulation paradigms. However, their tentative conclusion that macroscopic neocortex may be considered (approximately) a linear near-equilibrium system is premature and does not correspond to tentative conclusions drawn from other studies of neocortex. At this time, there exists an interdisciplinary multidimensional gradation on published studies of neocortex, with one primary dimension of mathematical physics represented by two extremes. At one extreme, there is much scientifically unsupported talk of chaos and quantum physics being responsible for many important macroscopic neocortical processes (involving many thousands to millions of neurons) (Wilczek, 1994). At another extreme, many non-mathematically trained neuroscientists uncritically lump all neocortical mathematical theory into one file, and consider only statistical averages of citations for opinions on the quality of that research (Nunez, 1995). In this context, it is important to appreciate that Wright and Liley (W&L) report on their scientifically sound studies on macroscopic neocortical function, based on simulation and a blend of sound theory and reproducible experiments. However, their pioneering work, given the absence of much knowledge of neocortex at this time, is open to criticism, especially with respect to their present inferences and conclusions. Their conclusion that EEG data exhibit linear near-equilibrium dynamics may very well be true, but only in the sense of focusing only on one local minima, possibly with individual-specific and physiological-state dependent ","Title: Volatility of Volatility of Financial Markets

Abstract: We present an on-line investment algorithm which achieves almost the same wealth as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight from the actual market outcomes. The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and requires only constant storage and computing time per stock in each trading period. We tested the performance of our algorithm on real stock data from the New York Stock Exchange accumulated during a 22-year period. On this data, our algorithm clearly outperforms the best single stock as well as Cover's universal portfolio selection algorithm. We also present results for the situation in which the investor has access to additional ""side information."" ","Title: A Comparison of New and Old Algorithms for A Mixture Estimation Problem  
Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating the proportion vector which maximizes the likelihood of a given sample for a mixture of given densities. We adapt a framework developed for supervised learning and give simple derivations for many of the standard iterative algorithms like gradient projection and EM. In this framework, the distance between the new and old proportion vectors is used as a penalty term. The square distance leads to the gradient projection update, and the relative entropy to a new update which we call the exponentiated gradient update (EG ). Curiously, when a second order Taylor expansion of the relative entropy is used, we arrive at an update EM which, for = 1, gives the usual EM update. Experimentally, both the EM -update and the EG -update for &gt; 1 outperform the EM algorithm and its variants. We also prove a polynomial bound on the rate of convergence of the EG algorithm. ",1
"Title: Beyond predictive accuracy: what?  
Abstract: Today's potential users of machine learning technology are faced with the non-trivial problem of choosing, from the large, ever-increasing number of available tools, the one most appropriate for their particular task. To assist the often non-initiated users, it is desirable that this model selection process be automated. Using experience from base level learning, researchers have proposed meta-learning as a possible solution. Historically, predictive accuracy has been the de facto criterion, with most work in meta-learning focusing on the discovery of rules that match applications to models based on accuracy only. Although predictive accuracy is clearly an important criterion, it is also the case that there are a number of other criteria that could, and often ought to, be considered when learning about model selection. This paper presents a number of such criteria and discusses the impact they have on meta-level approaches to model selection.","Title: Model selection using measure functions  
Abstract: The concept of measure functions for generalization performance is suggested. This concept provides an alternative way of selecting and evaluating learned models (classifiers). In addition, it makes it possible to state a learning problem as a computational problem. The the known prior (meta-)knowledge about the problem domain is captured in a measure function that, to each possible combination of a training set and a classifier, assigns a value describing how good the classifier is. The computational problem is then to find a classifier maximizing the measure function. We argue that measure functions are of great value for practical applications. Besides of being a tool for model selection, they: (i) force us to make explicit the relevant prior knowledge about the learning problem at hand, (ii) provide a deeper understanding of existing algorithms, and (iii) help us in the construction of problem-specific algorithms. We illustrate the last point by suggesting a novel algorithm based on incremental search for a classifier that optimizes a given measure function.",1
"Title: Query by Committee  
Abstract: We propose an algorithm called query by committee, in which a committee of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms. ","Title: Heterogeneous Uncertainty Sampling for Supervised Learning  
Abstract: Uncertainty sampling methods iteratively request class labels for training instances whose classes are uncertain despite the previous labeled instances. These methods can greatly reduce the number of instances that an expert need label. One problem with this approach is that the classifier best suited for an application may be too expensive to train or use during the selection of instances. We test the use of one classifier (a highly efficient probabilistic one) to select examples for training another (the C4.5 rule induction program). Despite being chosen by this heterogeneous approach, the uncertainty samples yielded classifiers with lower error rates than random samples ten times larger.",1
"Title: A Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Learning with Symbolic Features  
Abstract: In the past, nearest neighbor algorithms for learning from examples have worked best in domains in which all features had numeric values. In such domains, the examples can be treated as points and distance metrics can use standard definitions. In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances, and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity. We conclude that experimental evidence favors the use and continued development of nearest neighbor algorithms for domains such as the ones studied here. ","Title: EXPLORING A FRAMEWORK FOR INSTANCE BASED LEARNING AND NAIVE BAYESIAN CLASSIFIERS  
Abstract: The relative performance of different methods for classifier learning varies across domains. Some recent Instance Based Learning (IBL) methods, such as IB1-MVDM* 10 , use similarity measures based on conditional class probabilities. These probabilities are a key component of Naive Bayes methods. Given this commonality of approach, it is of interest to consider how the differences between the two methods are linked to their relative performance in different domains. Here we interpret Naive Bayes in an IBL like framework, identifying differences between Naive Bayes and IB1-MVDM* in this framework. Experiments on variants of IB1-MVDM* that lie between it and Naive Bayes in the framework are conducted on sixteen domains. The results strongly suggest that the relative performance of Naive Bayes and IB1-MVDM* is linked to the extent to which each class can be satisfactorily represented by a single instance in the IBL framework. However, this is not the only factor that appears significant. ",1
"Title: FLEXIBLE PARAMETRIC MEASUREMENT ERROR MODELS  
Abstract: Inferences in measurement error models can be sensitive to modeling assumptions. Specifically, if the model is incorrect then the estimates can be inconsistent. To reduce sensitivity to modeling assumptions and yet still retain the efficiency of parametric inference we propose to use flexible parametric models which can accommodate departures from standard parametric models. We use mixtures of normals for this purpose. We study two cases in detail: a linear errors-in-variables model and a change-point Berkson model. fl Raymond J.

Abstract: Weight modifications in traditional neural nets are computed by hard-wired algorithms. Without exception, all previous weight change algorithms have many specific limitations. Is it (in principle) possible to overcome limitations of hard-wired algorithms by allowing neural nets to run and improve their own weight change algorithms? This paper constructively demonstrates that the answer (in principle) is `yes'. I derive an initial gradient-based sequence learning algorithm for a `self-referential' recurrent network that can `speak' about its own weight matrix in terms of activations. It uses some of its input and output units for observing its own errors and for explicitly analyzing and modifying its own weight matrix, including those parts of the weight matrix responsible for analyzing and modifying the weight matrix. The result is the first `introspective' neural net with explicit potential control over all of its own adaptive parameters. A disadvantage of the algorithm is its high computational complexity per time step which is independent of the sequence length and equals O(n conn logn conn ), where n conn is the number of connections. Another disadvantage is the high number of local minima of the unusually complex error surface. The purpose of this paper, however, is not to come up with the most efficient `introspective' or `self-referential' weight change algorithm, but to show that such algorithms are possible at all. ",1

Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation.

"Title: Feature Subset Selection as Search with Probabilistic Estimates  
Abstract: Irrelevant features and weakly relevant features may reduce the comprehensibility and accuracy of concepts induced by supervised learning algorithms. We formulate the search for a feature subset as an abstract search problem with probabilistic estimates. Searching a space using an evaluation function that is a random variable requires trading off accuracy of estimates for increased state exploration. We show how recent feature subset selection algorithms in the machine learning literature fit into this search problem as simple hill climbing approaches, and conduct a small experiment using a best-first search technique. ","Title: Feature Subset Selection Using the Wrapper Method: Overfitting and Dynamic Search Space Topology  
Abstract: In the wrapper approach to feature subset selection, a search for an optimal set of features is made using the induction algorithm as a black box. The estimated future performance of the algorithm is the heuristic guiding the search. Statistical methods for feature subset selection including forward selection, backward elimination, and their stepwise variants can be viewed as simple hill-climbing techniques in the space of feature subsets. We utilize best-first search to find a good feature subset and discuss overfitting problems that may be associated with searching too many feature subsets. We introduce compound operators that dynamically change the topology of the search space to better utilize the information available from the evaluation of feature subsets. We show that compound operators unify previous approaches that deal with relevant and irrelevant features. The improved feature subset selection yields significant improvements for real-world datasets when using the ID3 and the Naive-Bayes induction algorithms. ",1
"Title: Evolutionary Training of CLP-Constrained Neural Networks  
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the integration of constraint logic programming systems (CLP) with systems based on genetic algorithms (GA). The resulting framework is tailored for applications that require a first phase in which a number of constraints need to be generated, and a second phase in which an optimal solution satisfying these constraints is produced. The first phase is carried by the CLP and the second one by the GA. We present a specific framework where ECL i PS e (ECRC Common Logic Programming System) and GENOCOP (GEnetic algorithm for Numerical Optimization for COnstrained Problems) are integrated in a framework called CoCo (COmputational intelligence plus COnstraint logic programming). The CoCo system is applied to the training problem for neural networks. We consider constrained networks, e.g. neural networks with shared weights, constraints on the weights for example domain constraints for hardware implementation etc. Then ECL i PS e is used to generate the chromosome representation together with other constraints which ensure, in most cases, that each network is specified by exactly one chromosome. Thus the problem becomes a constrained optimization problem, where the optimization criterion is to optimize the error of the network, and GENOCOP is used to find an optimal solution.

Abstract: In many applications, such as decision support, negotiation, planning, scheduling, etc., one needs to express requirements that can only be partially satisfied. In order to express such requirements, we propose a technique called forward-tracking. Intuitively, forward-tracking is a kind of dual of chronological back-tracking: if a program globally fails to find a solution, then a new execution is started from a program point and a state `forward' in the computation tree. This search technique is applied to constraint logic programming, obtaining a powerful extension that preserves all the useful properties of the original scheme. We report on the successful practical application of forward-tracking to the evolutionary training of (constrained) neural networks. ",1
"Title: Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction using Case-Based Reasoning Techniques  
Abstract: The Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DCSP) formalism has been gaining attention as a valuable and often necessary extension of the static CSP framework. Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction enables CSP techniques to be applied more extensively, since it can be applied in domains where the set of constraints and variables involved in the problem evolves with time. At the same time, the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) community has been working on techniques by which to reuse existing solutions when solving new problems. We have observed that dynamic constraint satisfaction matches very closely the case-based reasoning process of case adaptation. These observations emerged from our previous work on combining CBR and CSP to achieve a constraint-based adaptation. This paper summarizes our previous results, describes the similarity of the challenges facing both DCSP and case adaptation, and shows how CSP and CBR can together begin to address these chal lenges.","Title: Towards Improving Case Adaptability with a Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: Case combination is a difficult problem in Case Based Reasoning, as sub-cases often exhibit conflicts when merged together. In our previous work we formalized case combination by representing each case as a constraint satisfaction problem, and used the minimum conflicts algorithm to systematically synthesize the global solution. However, we also found instances of the problem in which the minimum conflicts algorithm does not perform case combination efficiently. In this paper we describe those situations in which initially retrieved cases are not easily adaptable, and propose a method by which to improve case adaptability with a genetic algorithm. We introduce a fitness function that maintains as much retrieved case information as possible, while also perturbing a sub-solution to allow subsequent case combination to proceed more efficiently.",1

Abstract: This article exposes problems of the commonly used technique of splitting the available data into training, validation, and test sets that are held fixed, warns about drawing too strong conclusions from such static splits, and shows potential pitfalls of ignoring variability across splits. Using a bootstrap or resampling method, we compare the uncertainty in the solution stemming from the data splitting with neural network specific uncertainties (parameter initialization, choice of number of hidden units, etc.). We present two results on data from the New York Stock Exchange. First, the variation due to different resamplings is significantly larger than the variation due to different network conditions. This result implies that it is important to not over-interpret a model (or an ensemble of models) estimated on one specific split of the data. Second, on each split, the neural network solution with early stopping is very close to a linear model; no significant nonlinearities are extracted.

"Title: GIT-CC-92/60 A Model-Based Approach to Analogical Reasoning and Learning in Design  
Abstract: A major issue in case-basedsystems is retrieving the appropriate cases from memory to solve a given problem. This implies that a case should be indexed appropriately when stored in memory. A case-based system, being dynamic in that it stores cases for reuse, needs to learn indices for the new knowledge as the system designers cannot envision that knowledge. Irrespective of the type of indexing (structural or functional), a hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models help in learning structural indices to design cases in the domain of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design provides both the vocabulary for structural indexing of design cases and the inductive biases for index generalization. We further discuss how model-based learning can be integrated with similarity-based learning (that uses prior design cases) for learning the level of index generalization. ","Title: Discovery of Physical Principles from Design Experiences  
Abstract: One method for making analogies is to access and instantiate abstract domain principles, and one method for acquiring knowledge of abstract principles is to discover them from experience. We view generalization over experiences in the absence of any prior knowledge of the target principle as the task of hypothesis formation, a subtask of discovery. Also, we view the use of the hypothesized principles for analogical design as the task of hypothesis testing, another subtask of discovery. In this paper, we focus on discovery of physical principles by generalization over design experiences in the domain of physical devices. Some important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. We represent a reasoner's comprehension of specific designs in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. An SBF model provides a functional and causal explanation of the working of a device. We represent domain principles as device-independent behavior-function (BF) models. We show that (i) the function of a device determines what to generalize from its SBF model, (ii) the SBF model itself suggests how far to generalize, and (iii) the typology of functions indicates what method to use.

"Title: The Automatic Programming of Agents that Learn Mental Models and Create Simple Plans of Action  
Abstract: An essential component of an intelligent agent is the ability to notice, encode, store, and utilize information about its environment. Traditional approaches to program induction have focused on evolving functional or reactive programs. This paper presents MAPMAKER, an approach to the automatic generation of agents that discover information about their environment, encode this information for later use, and create simple plans utilizing the stored mental models. In this approach, agents are multipart computer programs that communicate through a shared memory. Both the programs and the representation scheme are evolved using genetic programming. An illustrative problem of 'gold' collection is used to demonstrate the approach in which one part of a program makes a map of the world and stores it in memory, and the other part uses this map to find the gold The results indicate that the approach can evolve programs that store simple representations of their environments and use these representations to produce simple plans. 1.

Abstract: Fuzzy rules for control can be effectively tuned via reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a weak learning method, which only requires information on the success or failure of the control application. The tuning process allows people to generate fuzzy rules which are unable to accurately perform control and have them tuned to be rules which provide smooth control. This paper explores a new simplified method of using reinforcement learning for the tuning of fuzzy control rules. It is shown that the learned fuzzy rules provide smoother control in the pole balancing domain than another approach. ",1
"Title: Genetic Programming Bloat with Dynamic Fitness  
Abstract: Technical Report: CSRP-97-29, 3 December 1997 Abstract In artificial evolution individuals which perform as their parents are usually rewarded identically to their parents. We note that Nature is more dynamic and there may be a penalty to pay for doing the same thing as your parents. We report two sets of experiments where static fitness functions are firstly augmented by a penalty for unchanged offspring and secondly the static fitness case is replaced by randomly generated dynamic test cases. We conclude genetic programming, when evolving artificial ant control programs, is surprisingly little effected by large penalties and program growth is observed in all our experiments. ","Title: Why Ants are Hard genetic programming, simulated annealing and hill climbing performance is shown not
Abstract: The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used as an example program search space. Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for Genetic Algorithms. Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat. ",1
"Title: Input to State Stabilizability for Parameterized Families of Systems Key Words: Nonlinear stability, Robust control,
Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a system must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires a declaratflive representation of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task. This paper presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during this task, their declarative representations, and their associations with particular learning strategies. We propose a theory of Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. A program called Meta-AQUA embodies the theory and processes examples in the domain of drug smuggling. ","Title: A Smooth Converse Lyapunov Theorem for Robust Stability

We show also that RELIEFF is less myopic than other impurity functions and that it enables the induction algorithm that generates binary decision trees to reconstruct optimal (the smallest) decision trees in more cases.

We describe the advances that have been made on these topics in both empirical and theoretical work in machine learning, and we present a general framework that we use to compare different methods. We close with some challenges for future work in this area. ","Title: Flexible Metric Nearest Neighbor Classiflcation  
Abstract: The K-nearest-neighbor decision rule assigns an object of unknown class to the plurality class among the K labeled ""training"" objects that are closest to it. Closeness is usually deflned in terms of a metric distance on the Euclidean space with the input measurement variables as axes. The metric chosen to deflne this distance can strongly efiect performance. An optimal choice depends on the problem at hand as characterized by the respective class distributions on the input measurement space, and within a given problem, on the location of the unknown object in that space. In this paper new types of K-nearest-neighbor procedures are described that estimate the local relevance of each input variable, or their linear combinations, for each individual point to be classifled. This information is then used to separately customize the metric used to deflne distance from that object in flnding its nearest neighbors. These procedures are a hybrid between regular K-nearest-neighbor methods and treestructured recursive partitioning techniques popular in statistics and machine learning.",1
"Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees. Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity.

Abstract: This chapter describes three studies which address the question of how neural network learning can be improved via the incorporation of information extracted from other networks. This general problem, which we call network transfer, encompasses many types of relationships between source and target networks. Our focus is on the utilization of weights from source networks which solve a subproblem of the target network task, with the goal of speeding up learning on the target task. We demonstrate how the approach described here can improve learning speed by up to ten times over learning starting with random weights. ",1
"Title: Learning Algorithms with Applications to Robot Navigation and Protein Folding  
Abstract: Using scene analysis as the task, this research focuses on three fundamental problems in neural network systems: (1) limited processing resources, (2) representing schemas, and (3) learning schemas. The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures. ","Title: Exactly Learning Automata with Small Cover Time  
Abstract: We present algorithms for exactly learning unknown environments that can be described by deterministic finite automata. The learner performs a walk on the target automaton, where at each step it observes the output of the state it is at, and chooses a labeled edge to traverse to the next state. We assume that the learner has no means of a reset, and we also assume that the learner does not have access to a teacher that answers equivalence queries and gives the learner counterexamples to its hypotheses. We present two algorithms, one assumes that the outputs observed by the learner are always correct and the other assumes that the outputs might be erroneous. The running times of both algorithms are polynomial in the cover time of the underlying graph of the target automaton. ",1
"Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Diagnostics: A Comparative Review  
Abstract: A critical issue for users of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.

Abstract: Maximum working likelihood (MWL) inference in the presence of missing data can be quite challenging because of the intractability of the associated marginal likelihood. This problem can be further exacerbated when the number of parameters involved is large. We propose using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to first obtain both the MWL estimator and the working Fisher information matrix and, second, using Monte Carlo quadrature to obtain the remaining components of the correct asymptotic MWL variance. Evaluation of the marginal likelihood is not needed. We demonstrate consistency and asymptotic normality when the number of independent and identically distributed data clusters is large but the likelihood may be incorrectly specified. An analysis of longitudinal ordinal data is given for an example. KEY WORDS: Convergence of posterior distributions, Maximum likelihood, Metropolis ",1

Abstract: Graphical Markov models use graphs, either undirected, directed, or mixed, to represent possible dependences among statistical variables. Applications of undirected graphs (UDGs) include models for spatial dependence and image analysis, while acyclic directed graphs (ADGs), which are especially convenient for statistical analysis, arise in such fields as genetics and psychometrics and as models for expert systems and Bayesian belief networks. Lauritzen, Wer-muth, and Frydenberg (LWF) introduced a Markov property for chain graphs, which are mixed graphs that can be used to represent simultaneously both causal and associative dependencies and which include both UDGs and ADGs as special cases. In this paper an alternative Markov property (AMP) for chain graphs is introduced, which in some ways is a more direct extension of the ADG Markov property than is the LWF property for chain graph.",1
"Title: Alternative Discrete-Time Operators and Their Application to Nonlinear Models  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 275 Revised March 30, 1995 University of Washington Department of Statistics Seattle, Washington 98195 Abstract During the past few years several nonparametric alternatives to the Cox proportional hazards model have appeared in the literature. These methods extend techniques that are well known from regression analysis to the analysis of censored survival data. In this paper we discuss methods based on (partition) trees and (polynomial) splines, analyze two datasets using both Survival Trees[1] and HARE[2], and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods. One of the strengths of HARE is that its model fitting procedure has an implicit check for proportionality of the underlying hazards model. It also provides an explicit model for the conditional hazards function, which makes it very convenient to obtain graphical summaries. On the other hand, the tree-based methods automatically partition a dataset into groups of cases that are similar in survival history. Results obtained by survival trees and HARE are often complimentary. Trees and splines in survival analysis should provide the data analyst with two useful tools when analyzing survival data.","Title: Book Review  Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation Reviewed by: 2  
Abstract: Neural computation, also called connectionism, parallel distributed processing, neural network modeling or brain-style computation, has grown rapidly in the last decade. Despite this explosion, and ultimately because of impressive applications, there has been a dire need for a concise introduction from a theoretical perspective, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of connectionist approaches and establishing links to other disciplines, such as statistics or control theory. The Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation by Hertz, Krogh and Palmer (subsequently referred to as HKP) is written from the perspective of physics, the home discipline of the authors. The book fulfills its mission as an introduction for neural network novices, provided that they have some background in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. It covers a number of models that are often viewed as disjoint. Critical analyses and fruitful comparisons between these models ",1
"Title: Every Niching Method has its Niche: Fitness Sharing and Implicit Sharing Compared  
Abstract: Various extensions to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) attempt to find all or most optima in a search space containing several optima. Many of these emulate natural speciation. For co-evolutionary learning to succeed in a range of management and control problems, such as learning game strategies, such methods must find all or most optima. However, suitable comparison studies are rare. We compare two similar GA specia-tion methods, fitness sharing and implicit sharing. Using a realistic letter classification problem, we find they have advantages under different circumstances. Implicit sharing covers optima more comprehensively, when the population is large enough for a species to form at each optimum. With a population not large enough to do this, fitness sharing can find the optima with larger basins of attraction, and ignore the peaks with narrow bases, while implicit sharing is more easily distracted. This indicates that for a speciated GA trying to find as many near-global optima as possible, implicit sharing works well only if the population is large enough. This requires prior knowledge of how many peaks exist.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: Toward Learning Systems That Integrate Different Strategies and Representations TR93-22  
Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor . Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD() for arbitrary , for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using &gt; 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.","Title: An Incremental Interactive Algorithm for Regular Grammar Inference  
Abstract: We present provably correct interactive algorithms for learning regular grammars from positive examples and membership queries. A structurally complete set of strings from a language L(G) corresponding to a target regular grammar G implicitly specifies a lattice of finite state automata (FSA) which contains a FSA M G corresponding to G. The lattice is compactly represented as a version-space and M G is identified by searching the version-space using membership queries. We explore the problem of regular grammar inference in a setting where positive examples are provided intermittently. We provide an incremental version of the algorithm along with a set of sufficient conditions for its convergence.",1
"Title: Evolving Visual Routines  
Abstract: Traditional machine vision assumes that the vision system recovers a a complete, labeled description of the world [ Marr, 1982 ] . Recently, several researchers have criticized this model and proposed an alternative model which considers perception as a distributed collection of task-specific, task-driven visual routines [ Aloimonos, 1993, Ullman, 1987 ] . Some of these researchers have argued that in natural living systems these visual routines are the product of natural selection [ Ramachandran, 1985 ] . So far, researchers have hand-coded task-specific visual routines for actual implementations (e.g. [ Chapman, 1993 ] ). In this paper we propose an alternative approach in which visual routines for simple tasks are evolved using an artificial evolution approach. We present results from a series of runs on actual camera images, in which simple routines were evolved using Genetic Programming techniques [ Koza, 1992 ] . The results obtained are promising: the evolved routines are able to correctly classify up to 93% of the images, which is better than the best algorithm we were able to write by hand.

SFOIL is able to efficiently deal with this learning task which is to our knowledge one of the most complex learning task solved by an ILP system. This demonstrates that ILP systems can scale up to real databases and that top-down ILP systems that use the covering approach and advanced search strategies are appropriate for knowledge discovery in databases and are promising for further investigation.

"Title: Learning to be Selective in Genetic-Algorithm-Based Design Optimization  
Abstract: Lattice conditional independence (LCI) models for multivariate normal data recently have been introduced for the analysis of non-monotone missing data patterns and of nonnested dependent linear regression models ( seemingly unrelated regressions). It is shown here that the class of LCI models coincides with a subclass of the class of graphical Markov models determined by acyclic digraphs (ADGs), namely, the subclass of transitive ADG models. An explicit graph - theoretic characterization of those ADGs that are Markov equivalent to some transitive ADG is obtained. This characterization allows one to determine whether a specific ADG D is Markov equivalent to some transitive ADG, hence to some LCI model, in polynomial time, without an exhaustive search of the (exponentially large) equivalence class [D ]. These results do not require the existence or positivity of joint densities.","Title: Guided Crossover: A New Operator for Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. They have a much better chance of getting to global optima than gradient based methods which usually converge to local sub optima. However, GAs have a tendency of getting only moderately close to the optima in a small number of iterations. To get very close to the optima, the GA needs a very large number of iterations. Whereas gradient based optimizers usually get very close to local optima in a relatively small number of iterations. In this paper we describe a new crossover operator which is designed to endow the GA with gradient-like abilities without actually computing any gradients and without sacrificing global optimality. The operator works by using guidance from all members of the GA population to select a direction for exploration. Empirical results in two engineering design domains and across both binary and floating point representations demonstrate that the operator can significantly improve the steady state error of the GA optimizer.

Abstract: We define a Gamma multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as an MLP with the usual synaptic weights replaced by gamma filters (as proposed by de Vries and Principe (de Vries & Principe 1992)) and associated gain terms throughout all layers. We derive gradient descent update equations and apply the model to the recognition of speech phonemes. We find that both the inclusion of gamma filters in all layers, and the inclusion of synaptic gains, improves the performance of the Gamma MLP. We compare the Gamma MLP with TDNN, Back-Tsoi FIR MLP, and Back-Tsoi IIR MLP architectures, and a local approximation scheme. We find that the Gamma MLP results in a substantial reduction in error rates. ","Title: The Gamma MLP Using Multiple Temporal Resolutions for Improved Classification  
Abstract: We have previously introduced the Gamma MLP which is defined as an MLP with the usual synaptic weights replaced by gamma filters and associated gain terms throughout all layers. In this paper we apply the Gamma MLP to a larger scale speech phoneme recognition problem, analyze the operation of the network, and investigate why the Gamma MLP can perform better than alternatives. The Gamma MLP is capable of employing multiple temporal resolutions (the temporal resolution is defined here, as per de Vries and Principe, as the number of parameters of freedom (i.e. the number of tap variables) per unit of time in the gamma memory this is equal to the gamma memory parameter as detailed in the paper). Multiple temporal resolutions may be advantageous for certain problems, e.g. different resolutions may be optimal for extracting different features from the input data. For the problem in this paper, the Gamma MLP is observed to use a large range of temporal resolutions. In comparison, TDNN networks typically use only a single temporal resolution. Further motivation for the Gamma MLP is related to the curse of dimensionality and the ability of the Gamma MLP to trade off temporal resolution for memory depth, and therefore increase memory depth without increasing the dimensionality of the network. The IIR MLP is a more general version of the Gamma MLP however the IIR MLP performs poorly for the problem in this paper. Investigation suggests that the error surface of the Gamma MLP is more suitable for gradient descent training than the error surface of the IIR MLP. ",1
"Title: Word Perfect Corp. A TRANSFORMATION FOR IMPLEMENTING NEURAL NETWORKS WITH LOCALIST PROPERTIES  
Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a fixed topology during learning, and typically suffer from a number of shortcomings as a result. Variations of ANNs that use dynamic topologies have shown ability to overcome many of these problems. This paper introduces Location-Independent Transformations (LITs) as a general strategy for implementing feedforward networks that use dynamic topologies. A LIT creates a set of location-independent nodes, where each node computes its part of the network output independent of other nodes, using local information. This type of transformation allows efficient support for adding and deleting nodes dynamically during learning. In particular, this paper presents LITs for the single-layer competitve learning network, and the counterpropagation network, which combines elements of supervised learning with competitive learning. These two networks are localist in the sense that ultimately one node is responsible for each output. LITs for other models are presented in other papers.

Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity.

Abstract: As natural resources become less abundant, we naturally become more interested in, and more adept at utilisation of waste materials. In doing this we are bringing to bear a ploy which is of key importance in learning | or so I argue in this paper. In the `Truth from Trash' model, learning is viewed as a process which uses environmental feedback to assemble fortuitous sensory predispositions (sensory `trash') into useful, information vehicles, i.e., `truthful' indicators of salient phenomena. The main aim will be to show how a computer implementation of the model has been used to enhance (through learning) the strategic abilities of a simulated, football playing mobot.",1
"Title: Self Regenerative Markov Chain Monte Carlo  Summary  
Abstract: We propose a new method of construction of Markov chains with a given stationary distribution . This method is based on construction of an auxiliary chain with some other stationary distribution and picking elements of this auxiliary chain a suitable number of times. The proposed method has many advantages over its rivals. It is easy to implement; it provides a simple analysis; it can be faster and more efficient than the currently available techniques and it can also be adapted during the course of the simulation. We make theoretical and numerical comparisons of the characteristics of the proposed algorithm with some other MCMC techniques. ","Title: Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo through Regeneration  Summary  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for evaluating expectations of functions of interest under a target distribution . This is done by calculating averages over the sample path of a Markov chain having as its stationary distribution. For computational efficiency, the Markov chain should be rapidly mixing. This can sometimes be achieved only by careful design of the transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of . An alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of are encountered during the MCMC run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, the stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often, but which does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample-path averages.

"Title: Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators  
Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related to the usual empirical Bayes formulation of James-Stein estimators. We consider running a Gibbs sampler on this model. Using previous results about convergence rates of Markov chains, we provide rigorous, numerical, reasonable bounds on the running time of the Gibbs sampler, for a suitable range of prior distributions. We apply these results to baseball data from Efron and Morris (1975). For a different range of prior distributions, we prove that the Gibbs sampler will fail to converge, and use this information to prove that in this case the associated posterior distribution is non-normalizable.

Abstract: c flMIT Media Lab Perceptual Computing / Learning and Common Sense Technical Report 405 3nov96, revised 3jun97 Abstract We present methods for coupling hidden Markov models (hmms) to model systems of multiple interacting processes. The resulting models have multiple state variables that are temporally coupled via matrices of conditional probabilities. We introduce a deterministic O(T (CN ) 2 ) approximation for maximum a posterior (MAP) state estimation which enables fast classification and parameter estimation via expectation maximization. An ""N-heads"" dynamic programming algorithm samples from the highest probability paths through a compact state trellis, minimizing an upper bound on the cross entropy with the full (combinatoric) dynamic programming problem. The complexity is O(T (CN ) 2 ) for C chains of N states apiece observing T data points, compared with O(T N 2C ) for naive (Cartesian product), exact (state clustering), and stochastic (Monte Carlo) methods applied to the same inference problem. In several experiments examining training time, model likelihoods, classification accuracy, and robustness to initial conditions, coupled hmms compared favorably with conventional hmms and with energy-based approaches to coupled inference chains. We demonstrate and compare these algorithms on synthetic and real data, including interpretation of video.",1
"Title: The Power of Decision Tables  
Abstract: We evaluate the power of decision tables as a hypothesis space for supervised learning algorithms. Decision tables are one of the simplest hypothesis spaces possible, and usually they are easy to understand. Experimental results show that on artificial and real-world domains containing only discrete features, IDTM, an algorithm inducing decision tables, can sometimes outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as C4.5. Surprisingly, performance is quite good on some datasets with continuous features, indicating that many datasets used in machine learning either do not require these features, or that these features have few values. We also describe an incremental method for performing cross-validation that is applicable to incremental learning algorithms including IDTM. Using incremental cross-validation, it is possible to cross-validate a given dataset and IDTM in time that is linear in the number of instances, the number of features, and the number of label values. The time for incremental cross-validation is independent of the number of folds chosen, hence leave-one-out cross-validation and ten-fold cross-validation take the same time.

These approaches and several variants offer new computational and classifier characteristics that lend themselves to particular applications. ",1

Abstract: We analyse the biases of eleven measures for estimating the quality of the multi-valued attributes. The values of information gain, J-measure, gini-index, and relevance tend to linearly increase with the number of values of an attribute. The values of gain-ratio, distance measure, Relief , and the weight of evidence decrease for informative attributes and increase for irrelevant attributes. The bias of the statistic tests based on the chi-square distribution is similar but these functions are not able to discriminate among the attributes of different quality. We also introduce a new function based on the MDL principle whose value slightly decreases with the increasing number of attribute's values.","Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees. Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity. ",1
"Title: USING MARKER-BASED GENETIC ENCODING OF NEURAL NETWORKS TO EVOLVE FINITE-STATE BEHAVIOUR  
Abstract: A new mechanism for genetic encoding of neural networks is proposed, which is loosely based on the marker structure of biological DNA. The mechanism allows all aspects of the network structure, including the number of nodes and their connectivity, to be evolved through genetic algorithms. The effectiveness of the encoding scheme is demonstrated in an object recognition task that requires artificial creatures (whose behaviour is driven by a neural network) to develop high-level finite-state exploration and discrimination strategies. The task requires solving the sensory-motor grounding problem, i.e. developing a functional understanding of the effects that a creature's movement has on its sensory input.

Abstract: Technical Report AI94-223 May 1994 Abstract An important but often neglected problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence is that of grounding systems in their environment such that the representations they manipulate have inherent meaning for the system. Since humans rely so heavily on semantics, it seems likely that the grounding is crucial to the development of truly intelligent behavior. This study investigates the use of simulated robotic agents with neural network processors as part of a method to ensure grounding. Both the topology and weights of the neural networks are optimized through genetic algorithms. Although such comprehensive optimization is difficult, the empirical evidence gathered here shows that the method is not only tractable but quite fruitful. In the experiments, the agents evolved a wall-following control strategy and were able to transfer it to novel environments. Their behavior suggests that they were also learning to build cognitive maps. ",1
"Title: Chapter 4 Empirical comparison of stochastic algorithms Empirical comparison of stochastic algorithms in a graph
Abstract: There are several stochastic methods that can be used for solving NP-hard optimization problems approximatively. Examples of such algorithms include (in order of increasing computational complexity) stochastic greedy search methods, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. We investigate which of these methods is likely to give best performance in practice, with respect to the computational effort each requires. We study this problem empirically by selecting a set of stochastic algorithms with varying computational complexity, and by experimentally evaluating for each method how the goodness of the results achieved improves with increasing computational time. For the evaluation, we use a graph optimization problem, which is closely related to several real-world practical problems. To get a wider perspective of the goodness of the achieved results, the stochastic methods are also compared against special-case greedy heuristics. This investigation suggests that although genetic algorithms can provide good results, simpler stochastic algorithms can achieve similar performance more quickly.

Abstract: Air Traffic Control is involved in the real-time planning of aircraft trajectories. This is a heavily constrained optimization problem. We concentrate on free-route planning, in which aircraft are not required to fly over way points. The choice of a proper representation for this real-world problem is non-trivial. We propose a two level representation: one level on which the evolutionary operators work, and a derived level on which we do calculations. Furthermore we show that a specific choice of the fitness function is important for finding good solutions to large problem instances. We use a hybrid approach in the sense that we use knowledge about air traffic control by using a number of heuristics. We have built a prototype of a planning tool, and this resulted in a flexible tool for generating a free-route planning of low cost, for a number of aircraft. ",1

Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.","Title: Stochastic Propositionalization of Non-Determinate Background Knowledge  
Abstract: It is a well-known fact that propositional learning algorithms require ""good"" features to perform well in practice. So a major step in data engineering for inductive learning is the construction of good features by domain experts. These features often represent properties of structured objects, where a property typically is the occurrence of a certain substructure having certain properties. To partly automate the process of ""feature engineering"", we devised an algorithm that searches for features which are defined by such substructures. The algorithm stochastically conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each clause represents a binary feature. It differs from existing algorithms in that its search is not class-blind, and that it is capable of considering clauses (""context"") of almost arbitrary length (size). Preliminary experiments are favorable, and support the view that this approach is promising.",1
"Title: PREDICTION GAMES AND ARCING ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: Technical Report 504 December 19, 1997 Statistics Department University of California Berkeley, CA. (4720 Abstract The theory behind the success of adaptive reweighting and combining algorithms (arcing) such as Adaboost (Freund and Schapire [1995].[1996]) and others in reducing generalization error has not been well understood. By formulating prediction, both classification and regression, as a game where one player makes a selection from instances in the training set and the other a convex linear combination of predictors from a finite set, existing arcing algorithms are shown to be algorithms for finding good game strategies. An optimal game strategy finds a combined predictor that minimizes the maximum of the error over the training set. A bound on the generalization error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error is proven that is sharper than bounds to date. Arcing algorithms are described that converge to the optimal strategy. Schapire et.al. [1997] offered an explanation of why Adaboost works in terms of its ability to reduce the margin. Comparing Adaboost to our optimal arcing algorithm shows that their explanation is not valid and that the answer lies elsewhere. In this situation the VC-type bounds are misleading. Some empirical results are given to explore the situation. ","Title: A decision-theoretic generalization of on-line learning and an application to boosting how the weight-update rule

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update rule of Littlestone and Warmuth [10] can be adapted to this model yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games and prediction of points in R n",1

Abstract: Human episodic memory provides a seemingly unlimited storage for everyday experiences, and a retrieval system that allows us to access the experiences with partial activation of their components. The system is believed to consist of a fast, temporary storage in the hippocampus, and a slow, long-term storage within the neocortex. This paper presents a neural network model of the hippocampal episodic memory inspired by Damasio's idea of Convergence Zones. The model consists of a layer of perceptual feature maps and a binding layer. A perceptual feature pattern is coarse coded in the binding layer, and stored on the weights between layers. A partial activation of the stored features activates the binding pattern, which in turn reactivates the entire stored pattern. For many configurations of the model, a theoretical lower bound for the memory capacity can be derived, and it can be an order of magnitude or higher than the number of all units in the model, and several orders of magnitude higher than the number of binding-layer units. Computational simulations further indicate that the average capacity is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical lower bound, and making the connectivity between layers sparser causes an even further increase in capacity. Simulations also show that if more descriptive binding patterns are used, the errors tend to be more plausible (patterns are confused with other similar patterns), with a slight cost in capacity. The convergence-zone episodic memory therefore accounts for the immediate storage and associative retrieval capability and large capacity of the hippocampal memory, and shows why the memory encoding areas can be much smaller than the perceptual maps, consist of rather coarse computational units, and be only sparsely connected to the perceptual maps.

"Title: An Investigation of Marker-Passing Algorithms for Analogue Retrieval  
Abstract: If analogy and case-based reasoning systems are to scale up to very large case bases, it is important to analyze the various methods used for retrieving analogues to identify the features of the problem for which they are appropriate. This paper reports on one such analysis, a comparison of retrieval by marker passing or spreading activation in a semantic network with Knowledge-Directed Spreading Activation, a method developed to be well-suited for retrieving semantically distant analogues from a large knowledge base. The analysis has two complementary components: (1) a theoretical model of the retrieval time based on a number of problem characteristics, and (2) experiments showing how the retrieval time of the approaches varies with the knowledge base size. These two components, taken together, suggest that KDSA is more likely than SA to be able to scale up to retrieval in large knowledge bases.","Title: Applying Case Retrieval Nets to Diagnostic Tasks in Technical Domains

Abstract: University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Technical Report 876 (September 1989) Abstract In explanation-based learning, a specific problem's solution is generalized into a form that can be later used to solve conceptually similar problems. Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning. ",1
"Title: Priority ASOCS  ASOCS models have two significant advantages over other learning models:  
Abstract: This paper presents an ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System) model for massively parallel processing of incrementally defined rule systems in such areas as adaptive logic, robotics, logical inference, and dynamic control. An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. During learning mode, an ASOCS incorporates a rule expressed as a Boolean conjunction in a distributed fashion in time logarithmic in the number of rules. This paper proposes a learning algorithm and architecture for Priority ASOCS. This new ASOCS model uses rules with priorities. The new model has significant learning time and space complexity improvements over previous models. Non-von Neumann architectures such as neural networks attack the word-at-a-time bottleneck of traditional computing systems [1]. Neural networks learn input-output mappings using highly distributed processing and memory [10,11,12]. Their numerous simple processing elements with modifiable weighted links permit a high degree of parallelism. A typical neural network has fixed topology. It learns by modifying weighted links between nodes. A new class of connectionist architectures has been proposed called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) [4,5]. ASOCS models support efficient computation through self-organized learning and parallel execution. Learning is done through the incremental presentation of rules and/or examples. ASOCS models learn by modifying their topology. Data types include Boolean and multi-state variables; recent models support analog variables. The model incorporates rules into an adaptive logic network in a parallel and self organizing fashion. In processing mode, ASOCS supports fully parallel execution on actual inputs according to the learned rules. The adaptive logic network acts as a parallel hardware circuit during execution, mapping n input boolean vectors into m output boolean vectors, in a combinatoric fashion. The overall philosophy of ASOCS follows the high level goals of current neural network models. However, the mechanisms of learning and execution vary significantly. The ASOCS logic network is topologically dynamic with the network growing to efficiently fit the specific application. Current ASOCS models are based on digital nodes. ASOCS also supports use of symbolic and heuristic learning mechanisms, thus combining the parallelism and distributed nature of connectionist computing with the potential power of AI symbolic learning. A proof of concept ASOCS chip has been developed [2]. ","Title: Analysis of the Convergence and Generalization of AA1  
Abstract: that is based on Angluin's L fl algorithm. The algorithm maintains a model consistent with its past examples. When a new counterexample arrives it tries to extend the model in a minimal fashion. We conducted a set of experiments where random automata that represent different strategies were generated, and the algorithm tried to learn them based on prefix-closed samples of their behavior. The algorithm managed to learn very compact models that agree with the samples. The size of the sample had a small effect on the size of the model. The experimental results suggest that for random prefix-closed samples the algorithm behaves well. However, following Angluin's result on the difficulty of learning almost uniform complete samples [ An-gluin, 1978 ] , it is obvious that our algorithm does not solve the complexity issue of inferring a DFA from a general prefix-closed sample.

A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ""counts"" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.",1

Abstract: In most applications of neuro-evolution, each individual in the population represents a complete neural network. Recent work on the SANE system, however, has demonstrated that evolving individual neurons often produces a more efficient genetic search. This paper demonstrates that while SANE can solve easy tasks very quickly, it often stalls in larger problems. A hierarchical approach to neuro-evolution is presented that overcomes SANE's difficulties by integrating both a neuron-level exploratory search and a network-level exploitive search. In a robot arm manipulation task, the hierarchical approach outperforms both a neuron-based search and a network-based search. ",1
"Title: Constructive Training Methods for Feedforward Neural Networks with Binary Weights  
Abstract: DIMACS Technical Report 95-35 August 1995 ","Title: Orthogonal incremental learning of a feedforward network  
Abstract: Orthogonal incremental learning (OIL) is a new approach of incremental training for a feedforward network with a single hidden layer. OIL is based on the idea to describe the output weights (but not the hidden nodes) as a set of orthogonal basis functions. Hidden nodes are treated as the orthogonal representation of the network in the output weights domain. We proved that a separate training of hidden nodes does not conflict with previously optimized nodes and is described by a special relationship orthogonal backpropagation (OBP) rule. An advantage of OIL over existing algorithms is extremely fast learning. This approach can be also easily extended to build-up incrementally an arbitrary function as a linear composition of adjustable functions which are not necessarily orthogonal. OIL has been tested on `two-spirals' and `Net Talk' benchmark problems. ",1

"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation.

Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains it was observed that a simple classical implementation of the GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover was sometimes inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. Using floating point representation alone does not eliminate the problem. In this paper we describe a way of augmenting the GA with new operators and strategies that take advantage of the structure and properties of such engineering design domains. Empirical results (initially in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft and the domain of high performance supersonic missile inlet design) demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in terms of efficiency and reliability. http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~shehata/papers.html",1

Abstract: Model learning combined with dynamic programming has been shown to be effective for learning control of continuous state dynamic systems. The simplest method assumes the learned model is correct and applies dynamic programming to it, but many approximators provide uncertainty estimates on the fit. How can they be exploited? This paper addresses the case where the system must be prevented from having catastrophic failures during learning. We propose a new algorithm adapted from the dual control literature and use Bayesian locally weighted regression models with stochastic dynamic programming. A common reinforcement learning assumption is that aggressive exploration should be encouraged. This paper addresses the converse case in which the system has to reign in exploration.

Abstract: Graphical models enhance the representational power of probability models through qualitative characterization of their properties. This also leads to greater efficiency in terms of the computational algorithms that empower such representations. The increasing complexity of these models, however, quickly renders exact probabilistic calculations infeasible. We propose a principled framework for approximating graphical models based on variational methods. We develop variational techniques from the perspective that unifies and expands their applicability to graphical models. These methods allow the (recursive) computation of upper and lower bounds on the quantities of interest. Such bounds yield considerably more information than mere approximations and provide an inherent error metric for tailoring the approximations individually to the cases considered. These desirable properties, concomitant to the variational methods, are unlikely to arise as a result of other deterministic or stochastic approximations. ","Title: Large Deviation Methods for Approximate Probabilistic Inference, with Rates of Convergence a free parameter. The
Abstract: We study layered belief networks of binary random variables in which the conditional probabilities Pr[childjparents] depend monotonically on weighted sums of the parents. For these networks, we give efficient algorithms for computing rigorous bounds on the marginal probabilities of evidence at the output layer. Our methods apply generally to the computation of both upper and lower bounds, as well as to generic transfer function parameterizations of the conditional probability tables (such as sigmoid and noisy-OR). We also prove rates of convergence of the accuracy of our bounds as a function of network size. Our results are derived by applying the theory of large deviations to the weighted sums of parents at each node in the network. Bounds on the marginal probabilities are computed from two contributions: one assuming that these weighted sums fall near their mean values, and the other assuming that they do not. This gives rise to an interesting trade-off between probable explanations of the evidence and improbable deviations from the mean. In networks where each child has N parents, the gap between our upper and lower bounds behaves as a sum of two terms, one of order p In addition to providing such rates of convergence for large networks, our methods also yield efficient algorithms for approximate inference in fixed networks.

"Title: Parzen. On estimation of a probability density function and mode. Annual Mathematical Statistics, 33:1065-1076, 1962.
Abstract: To apply the algorithm for classification we assign each class a separate set of codebook Gaussians. Each set is only trained with patterns from a single class. After having trained the codebook Gaussians, each set provides an estimate of the probability function of one class; just as with Parzen window estimation, we take as the estimate of the pattern distribution the average of all Gaussians in the set. Classification of a pattern may now be done by calculating the probability of each class at the respective sample point, and assigning to the pattern the class with the highest probability. Hence the whole codebook plays a role in the classification of patterns. This is not the case with regular classification schemes using codebooks. We have tested the classification scheme on several classification tasks including the two spiral problem. We compared our algorithm to various other classification algorithms and it came out second; the best algorithm for the applications is the Parzen window estimation. However, the computing time and memory for Parzen window estimation are excessive when compared to our algorithm, and hence, in practical situations, our algorithm is to be preferred. We have developed a fast algorithm which combines attractive properties of both Parzen window estimation and vector quantization. The scale parameter is tuned adaptively and, therefore, is not set in an ad hoc manner. It allows a classification strategy in which all the codebook vectors are taken into account. This yields better results than the standard vector quantization techniques. An interesting topic for further research is to use radially non-symmetric Gaussians. ","Title: Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Probability Density Functions  
Abstract: Accurate and fast estimation of probability density functions is crucial for satisfactory computational performance in many scientific problems. When the type of density is known a priori, then the problem becomes statistical estimation of parameters from the observed values. In the non-parametric case, usual estimators make use of kernel functions. If X j ; j = 1; 2; : : : ; n is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with estimated probability density function f n , in the kernel method the computation of the values f n (X 1 ); f n (X 2 ); : : : ; f n (X n ) requires O(n 2 ) operations, since each kernel needs to be evaluated at every X j . We propose a sequence of special weight functions for the non-parametric estimation of f which requires almost linear time: if m is a slowly growing function that increases without bound with n, our method requires only O(m 2 n) arithmetic operations. We derive conditions for convergence under a number of metrics, which turn out to be similar to those required for the convergence of kernel based methods. We also discuss experiments on different distributions and compare the efficiency and the accuracy of our computations with kernel based estimators for various values of n and m. ",1

Abstract: Using the multi-parent diagonal and scanning crossover in GAs reproduction operators obtain an adjustable arity. Hereby sexuality becomes a graded feature instead of a Boolean one. Our main objective is to relate the performance of GAs to the extent of sexuality used for reproduction on less arbitrary functions then those reported in the current literature. We investigate GA behaviour on Kauffman's NK-landscapes that allow for systematic characterization and user control of ruggedness of the fitness landscape. We test GAs with a varying extent of sexuality, ranging from asexual to 'very sexual'. Our tests were performed on two types of NK-landscapes: landscapes with random and landscapes with nearest neighbour epistasis. For both landscape types we selected landscapes from a range of ruggednesses. The results confirm the superiority of (very) sexual recombination on mildly epistatic problems.","Title: On the Effectiveness of Evolutionary Search in High-Dimensional NK-Landscapes  
Abstract: NK-landscapes offer the ability to assess the performance of evolutionary algorithms on problems with different degrees of epistasis. In this paper, we study the performance of six algorithms in NK-landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant. The results show that compared to genetic local search algorithms, the performance of standard genetic algorithms employing crossover or mutation significantly decreases with increasing problem size. Furthermore, with increasing K, crossover based algorithms are in both cases outperformed by mutation based algorithms. However, the relative performance differences between the algorithms grow significantly with the dimension of the search space, indicating that it is important to consider high-dimensional landscapes for evaluating the performance of evolutionary algorithms.

"Title: An Analysis of Bayesian Classifiers (1988), involves the formulation of average-case models for specific algorithms
Abstract: In this paper we present an average-case analysis of the Bayesian classifier, a simple induction algorithm that fares remarkably well on many learning tasks. Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for artificial domains, and give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning. One goal of research in machine learning is to discover principles that relate algorithms and domain characteristics to behavior. To this end, many researchers have carried out systematic experimentation with natural and artificial domains in search of empirical regularities (e.g., Kibler & Langley, 1988). Others have focused on theoretical analyses, often within the paradigm of probably approximately correct learning (e.g., Haus-sler, 1990). However, most experimental studies are based only on informal analyses of the learning task, whereas most formal analyses address the worst case, and thus bear little relation to empirical results. ber of attributes, and the class and attribute frequencies, they obtain predictions about the behavior of induction algorithms and used experiments to check their analyses. 1 However, their research does not focus on algorithms typically used by the experimental and practical sides of machine learning, and it is important that average-case analyses be extended to such methods. Recently, there has been growing interest in probabilistic approaches to inductive learning. For example, Fisher (1987) has described Cobweb, an incremental algorithm for conceptual clustering that draws heavily on Bayesian ideas, and the literature reports a number of systems that build on this work (e.g., Allen & Lang-ley, 1990; Iba & Gennari, 1991; Thompson & Langley, 1991). Cheeseman et al. (1988) have outlined Auto-Class, a nonincremental system that uses Bayesian methods to cluster instances into groups, and other researchers have focused on the induction of Bayesian inference networks (e.g., Cooper & Kerskovits, 1991). These recent Bayesian learning algorithms are complex and not easily amenable to analysis, but they share a common ancestor that is simpler and more tractable. This supervised algorithm, which we refer to simply as a Bayesian classifier, comes originally from work in pattern recognition (Duda & Hart, 1973). The method stores a probabilistic summary for each class; this summary contains the conditional probability of each attribute value given the class, as well as the probability (or base rate) of the class. This data structure approximates the representational power of a perceptron; it describes a single decision boundary through the instance space. When the algorithm encounters a new instance, it updates the probabilities stored with the specified class. Neither the order of training instances nor the occurrence of classification errors have any effect on this process. When given a test instance, the classifier uses an evaluation function (which we describe in detail later) to rank the alter ","Title: Induction of One-Level Decision Trees  
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress on the worst-case analysis of inductive learning tasks, but for theoretical results to have impact on practice, they must deal with the average case. In this paper we present an average-case analysis of a simple algorithm that induces one-level decision trees for concepts defined by a single relevant attribute. Given knowledge about the number of training instances, the number of irrelevant attributes, the amount of class and attribute noise, and the class and attribute distributions, we derive the expected classification accuracy over the entire instance space. We then examine the predictions of this analysis for different settings of these domain parameters, comparing them to exper imental results to check our reasoning. ",1

The paper presents a detailed experimental study of SMART on a large unreliable production inventory problem. SMART outperforms two well-known reliability heuristics from industrial engineering. A key feature of this study is the integration of the reinforcement learning algorithm directly into two commercial discrete-event simulation packages, ARENA and CSIM, paving the way for this approach to be applied to many other factory optimization problems for which there already exist simulation models.",1

Abstract: An essential component of an intelligent agent is the ability to notice, encode, store, and utilize information about its environment. Traditional approaches to program induction have focused on evolving functional or reactive programs. This paper presents MAPMAKER, an approach to the automatic generation of agents that discover information about their environment, encode this information for later use, and create simple plans utilizing the stored mental models. In this approach, agents are multipart computer programs that communicate through a shared memory. Both the programs and the representation scheme are evolved using genetic programming. An illustrative problem of 'gold' collection is used to demonstrate the approach in which one part of a program makes a map of the world and stores it in memory, and the other part uses this map to find the gold The results indicate that the approach can evolve programs that store simple representations of their environments and use these representations to produce simple plans. 1.

This paper describes and compares three kinds of algorithms that learn axis-parallel rectangles to solve the multiple-instance problem. Algorithms that ignore the multiple instance problem perform very poorly. An algorithm that directly confronts the multiple instance problem (by attempting to identify which feature vectors are responsible for the observed classifications) performs best, giving 89% correct predictions on a musk-odor prediction task. The paper also illustrates the use of artificial data to debug and compare these algorithms. ",1
"Title: Interactive Segmentation of Three-dimensional Medical Images (Extended abstract)  
Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

Abstract: Naive-Bayes induction algorithms were previously shown to be surprisingly accurate on many classification tasks even when the conditional independence assumption on which they are based is violated. However, most studies were done on small databases. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scale up as well as decision trees. We then propose a new algorithm, NBTree, which induces a hybrid of decision-tree classifiers and Naive-Bayes classifiers: the decision-tree nodes contain uni-variate splits as regular decision-trees, but the leaves contain Naive-Bayesian classifiers. The approach retains the interpretability of Naive-Bayes and decision trees, while resulting in classifiers that frequently outperform both constituents, especially in the larger databases tested.

The accuracy of the new criteria is comparable to that of the current method used in C4.5.",1

Abstract: In this paper, we further characterize the complexity of noise-tolerant learning in the PAC model. Specifically, we show a general lower bound of log(1=ffi) on the number of examples required for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise. Combined with a result of Simon, we effectively show that the sample complexity of PAC learning in the presence of classification noise is VC(F) ""(12) 2 : Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of the general lower bound by providing a noise-tolerant learning algorithm for the class of symmetric Boolean functions which uses a sample size within a constant factor of this bound. Finally, we note that our general lower bound compares favorably with various general upper bounds for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise.

"Title: A Functional Theory of Creative Reading  
Abstract: Reading is an area of human cognition which has been studied for decades by psychologists, education researchers, and artificial intelligence researchers. Yet, there still does not exist a theory which accurately describes the complete process. We believe that these past attempts fell short due to an incomplete understanding of the overall task of reading; namely, the complete set of mental tasks a reasoner must perform to read and the mechanisms that carry out these tasks. We present a functional theory of the reading process and argue that it represents a coverage of the task. The theory combines experimental results from psychology, artificial intelligence, education, and linguistics, along with the insights we have gained from our own research. This greater understanding of the mental tasks necessary for reading will enable new natural language understanding systems to be more flexible and more capable than earlier ones. Furthermore, we argue that creativity is a necessary component of the reading process and must be considered in any theory or system attempting to describe it. We present a functional theory of creative reading and a novel knowledge organization scheme that supports the creativity mechanisms. The reading theory is currently being implemented in the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Creativity) system, a computer system which reads science fiction stories. fl This paper is part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing, Technical Report series.

"Title: d d MISC: A Multiple Instruction Stream Computer  
Abstract: This paper describes a single chip Multiple Instruction Stream Computer (MISC) capable of extracting instruction level parallelism from a broad spectrum of programs. The MISC architecture uses multiple asynchronous processing elements to separate a program into streams that can be executed in parallel, and integrates a conflict-free message passing system into the lowest level of the processor design to facilitate low latency intra-MISC communication. This approach allows for increased machine parallelism with minimal code expansion, and provides an alternative approach to single instruction stream multi-issue machines such as SuperScalar and VLIW.

Abstract To achieve high performance, contemporary computer systems rely on two forms of parallelism: instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and thread-level parallelism (TLP). Wide-issue superscalar processors exploit ILP by executing multiple instructions from a single program in a single cycle. Multiprocessors (MP) exploit TLP by executing different threads in parallel on different processors. Unfortunately, both parallel-processing styles statically partition processor resources, thus preventing them from adapting to dynamically-changing levels of ILP and TLP in a program. With insufficient TLP, processors in an MP will be idle; with insufficient ILP, multiple-issue hardware on a superscalar is wasted. This paper explores parallel processing on an alternative architecture, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which allows multiple threads to compete for and share all of the processors resources every cycle. The most compelling reason for running parallel applications on an SMT processor is its ability to use thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism interchangeably. By permitting multiple threads to share the processors functional units simultaneously, the processor can use both ILP and TLP to accommodate variations in parallelism. When a program has only a single thread, all of the SMT processors resources can be dedicated to that thread; when more TLP exists, this parallelism can compensate for a lack of ",1
"Title: Generalized Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic-programming and Reinforcement-learning Algorithms  
Abstract: The problem of maximizing the expected total discounted reward in a completely observable Markovian environment, i.e., a Markov decision process (mdp), models a particular class of sequential decision problems. Algorithms have been developed for making optimal decisions in mdps given either an mdp specification or the opportunity to interact with the mdp over time. Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling. Central to the results are the contraction property of the value operator and a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence. ","Title: Learning to Achieve Goals  
Abstract: Temporal difference methods solve the temporal credit assignment problem for reinforcement learning. An important subproblem of general reinforcement learning is learning to achieve dynamic goals. Although existing temporal difference methods, such as Q learning, can be applied to this problem, they do not take advantage of its special structure. This paper presents the DG-learning algorithm, which learns efficiently to achieve dynamically changing goals and exhibits good knowledge transfer between goals. In addition, this paper shows how traditional relaxation techniques can be applied to the problem. Finally, experimental results are given that demonstrate the superiority of DG learning over Q learning in a moderately large, synthetic, non-deterministic domain.",1
"Title: Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away  
Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acquire complete, parity mappings. But it is often overlooked that state-of-the-art learning methods such as C4.5 and backpropagation cannot generalise from incomplete parity mappings. The failure of such methods to generalise on parity mappings may be sometimes dismissed on the grounds that it is `impossible' to generalise over such mappings, or that parity problems are mathematical constructs having little to do with real-world learning. However, this paper argues that such a dismissal is unwarranted. It shows that parity mappings are hard to learn because they are statistically neutral and that statistical neutrality is a property which we should expect to encounter frequently in real-world contexts. It also shows that the generalization failure on parity mappings occurs even when large, minimally incomplete mappings are used for training purposes, i.e., when claims about the impossibility of generalization are particularly suspect.","Title: Truth-from-Trash Learning and the Mobot

In the `Truth from Trash' model, learning is viewed as a process which uses environmental feedback to assemble fortuitous sensory predispositions (sensory `trash') into useful, information vehicles, i.e., `truthful' indicators of salient phenomena.

Abstract: A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near) tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and image analysis.

The convergence of this algorithm and various ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described.

"Title: Stochastic Hillclimbing as a Baseline Method for Evaluating Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of stochastic hillclimbing as a baseline for evaluating the performance of genetic algorithms (GAs) as combinatorial function optimizers. In particular, we address four problems to which GAs have been applied in the literature: the maximum cut problem, Koza's 11-multiplexer problem, MDAP (the Multiprocessor Document Allocation Problem), and the jobshop problem. We demonstrate that simple stochastic hillclimbing methods are able to achieve results comparable or superior to those obtained by the GAs designed to address these four problems. We further illustrate, in the case of the jobshop problem, how insights obtained in the formulation of a stochastic hillclimbing algorithm can lead to improvements in the encoding used by a GA. fl Department of Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley.

Abstract: There are several stochastic methods that can be used for solving NP-hard optimization problems approximatively. Examples of such algorithms include (in order of increasing computational complexity) stochastic greedy search methods, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. We investigate which of these methods is likely to give best performance in practice, with respect to the computational effort each requires. We study this problem empirically by selecting a set of stochastic algorithms with varying computational complexity, and by experimentally evaluating for each method how the goodness of the results achieved improves with increasing computational time. For the evaluation, we use a graph optimization problem, which is closely related to several real-world practical problems. To get a wider perspective of the goodness of the achieved results, the stochastic methods are also compared against special-case greedy heuristics. This investigation suggests that although genetic algorithms can provide good results, simpler stochastic algorithms can achieve similar performance more quickly. ",1

Abstract: It is well known that standard learning classifier systems, when applied to many different domains, exhibit a number of problems: payoff oscillation, difficult to regulate interplay between the reward system and the background genetic algorithm (GA), rule chains instability, default hierarchies instability, are only a few. ALECSYS is a parallel version of a standard learning classifier system (CS), and as such suffers of these same problems. In this paper we propose some innovative solutions to some of these problems. We introduce the following original features. Mutespec, a new genetic operator used to specialize potentially useful classifiers.

Dynamical adjustment of the classifiers set cardinality, in order to speed up the performance phase of the algorithm.

Abstract: Keywords: Case-Based Reasoning, case retrieval, case representation This paper deals with the retrieval of useful cases in case-based reasoning. It focuses on the questions of what ""useful"" could mean and how the search for useful cases can be organized. We present the new search algorithm Fish and Shrink that is able to search quickly through the case base, even if the aspects that deflne usefulness are spontaneously combined at query time. We compare Fish and Shrink to other algorithms and show that most of them make an implicit closed world assumption.

The question is now how to prepare the previously collected cases and how to deflne a retrieval algorithm which is able to deal with sponta neously user-deflned similarity measures.","Title: Automatic Indexing, Retrieval and Reuse of Topologies in Architectual Layouts  
Abstract: Former layouts contain much of the know-how of architects. A generic and automatic way to formalize this know-how in order to use it by a computer would save a lot of effort and money. However, there seems to be no such way. The only access to the know-how are the layouts themselves. Developing a generic software tool to reuse former layouts you cannot consider every part of the architectual domain or things like personal style. Tools used today only consider small parts of the architectual domain. Any personal style is ignored. Isn't it possible to build a basic tool which is adjusted by the content of the former layouts, but may be extended incremently by modeling as much of the domain as desirable? This paper will describe a reuse tool to perform this task focusing on topological and geometrical binary relations.",1

Abstract: A novel method for regression has been recently proposed by V. Vapnik et al. [8, 9]. The technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), is very well founded from the mathematical point of view and seems to provide a new insight in function approximation. We implemented the SVM and tested it on the same data base of chaotic time series that was used in [1] to compare the performances of different approximation techniques, including polynomial and rational approximation, local polynomial techniques, Radial Basis Functions, and Neural Networks. The SVM performs better than the approaches presented in [1]. We also study, for a particular time series, the variability in performance with respect to the few free parameters of SVM.","Title: PREDICTING SUNSPOTS AND EXCHANGE RATES WITH CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS  
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of connectionist networks for predicting the future continuation of temporal sequences. The problem of overfitting, particularly serious for short records of noisy data, is addressed by the method of weight-elimination: a term penalizing network complexity is added to the usual cost function in back-propagation. The ultimate goal is prediction accuracy. We analyze two time series. On the benchmark sunspot series, the networks outperform traditional statistical approaches. We show that the network performance does not deteriorate when there are more input units than needed. Weight-elimination also manages to extract some part of the dynamics of the notoriously noisy currency exchange rates and makes the network solution interpretable. ",1

Abstract: Selecting a set of features which is optimal for a given task is a problem which plays an important role in a wide variety of contexts including pattern recognition, adaptive control, and machine learning.

Results are presented which suggest that genetic algorithms can be used to increase the robustness of feature selection algorithms without a significant decrease in computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper we initiate an investigation of generalizations of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model that attempt to significantly weaken the target function assumptions. The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables.

"Title: Near-Optimal Performance for Reinforcement Learning in Polynomial Time  
Abstract: We present new algorithms for reinforcement learning and prove that they have polynomial bounds on the resources required to achieve near-optimal return in general Markov decision processes. After observing that the number of actions required to approach the optimal return is lower bounded by the mixing time T of the optimal policy (in the undiscounted case) or by the horizon time T (in the discounted case), we then give algorithms requiring a number of actions and total computation time that are only polynomial in T and the number of states, for both the undiscounted and discounted cases. An interesting aspect of our algorithms is their explicit handling of the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off. These are the first results in the reinforcement learning literature giving algorithms that provably converge to near-optimal performance in polynomial time for general Markov decision processes.

Abstract: Recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning have yielded a number of new algorithms for the prediction and control of Markovian environments.

In this paper we provide a rigorous proof of convergence of these DP-based learning algorithms by relating them to the powerful techniques of stochastic approximation theory via a new convergence theorem. The theorem establishes a general class of convergent algorithms to which both TD() and Q-learning belong.

Abstract: CLONES is a object-oriented library for constructing, training and utilizing layered connectionist networks. The CLONES library contains all the object classes needed to write a simulator with a small amount of added source code (examples are included).

The library includes database, network behavior and training procedures that can be customized by the user. It is designed to run efficiently on data parallel computers (such as the RAP [6] and SPERT [1]) as well as uniprocessor workstations. While efficiency and portability to parallel computers are the primary goals, there are several secondary design goals: 3. allow heterogeneous algorithms and training procedures to be interconnected and trained together.

Abstract: Specification refinement is part of formal program derivation, a method by which software is directly constructed from a provably correct specification. Because program derivation is an intensive manual exercise used for critical software systems, an automated approach would allow it to be viable for many other types of software systems. The goal of this research is to determine if genetic programming (GP) can be used to automate the specification refinement process. The initial steps toward this goal are to show that a well-known proof logic for program derivation can be encoded such that a GP-based system can infer sentences in the logic for proof of a particular sentence. The results are promising and indicate that GP can be useful in aiding pro gram derivation.","Title: Strongly Typed Genetic Programming  
Abstract: BBN Technical Report #7866: Abstract Genetic programming is a powerful method for automatically generating computer programs via the process of natural selection [Koza 92]. However, it has the limitation known as ""closure"", i.e. that all the variables, constants, arguments for functions, and values returned from functions must be of the same data type. To correct this deficiency, we introduce a variation of genetic programming called ""strongly typed"" genetic programming (STGP). In STGP, variables, constants, arguments, and returned values can be of any data type with the provision that the data type for each such value be specified beforehand. This allows the initialization process and the genetic operators to only generate syntactically correct parse trees. Key concepts for STGP are generic functions, which are not true strongly typed functions but rather templates for classes of such functions, and generic data types, which are analogous. To illustrate STGP, we present four examples involving vector/matrix manipulation and list manipulation: (1) the multi-dimensional least-squares regression problem, (2) the multi-dimensional Kalman filter, (3) the list manipulation function NTH, and (4) the list manipulation function MAPCAR.",1

Abstract: We quantify both experimentally and analytically the performance of memory-based reasoning (MBR) algorithms. To start gaining insight into the capabilities of MBR algorithms, we compare an MBR algorithm using a value difference metric to a popular Bayesian classifier. These two approaches are similar in that they both make certain independence assumptions about the data. However, whereas MBR uses specific cases to perform classification, Bayesian methods summarize the data probabilistically. We demonstrate that a particular MBR system called Pebls works comparatively well on a wide range of domains using both real and artificial data. With respect to the artificial data, we consider distributions where the concept classes are separated by functional discriminants, as well as time-series data generated by Markov models of varying complexity. Finally, we show formally that Pebls can learn (in the limit) natural concept classes that the Bayesian classifier cannot learn, and that it will attain perfect accuracy whenever ","Title: Logarithmic-Time Updates and Queries in Probabilistic Networks  
Abstract: Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in time O(1) and queries are processed in time O(N ), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N ) at the expense of O(log N ) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.",1
"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Best-First Model Merging for Dynamic Learning and Recognition

"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

Abstract: This paper proposes four performance measures of a genetic algorithm (GA) which enable us to compare different GAs for an op timization problem and different choices of their parameters' values.

We present a case study in which parameters of a GA for robot path planning was tuned and its performance was optimized through performance evaluation by using the measures. Especially, one of the performance measures is used to demonstrate the adaptivity of the GA for robot path planning. We also propose a process of systematic tuning based on techniques for the design of experiments. ",1
"Title: Simple Synchrony Networks: Learning Generalisations across Syntactic Constituents  
Abstract: This paper describes a training algorithm for Simple Synchrony Networks (SSNs), and reports on experiments in language learning using a recursive grammar. The SSN is a new connectionist architecture combining a technique for learning about patterns across time, Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs), with Temporal Synchrony Variable Binding (TSVB). The use of TSVB means the SSN can learn about entities in the training set, and generalise this information to entities in the test set. In the experiments, the network is trained on sentences with up to one embedded clause, and with some words restricted to certain classes of constituent. During testing, the network generalises information learned to sentences with up to three embedded clauses, and with words appearing in any constituent. These results demonstrate that SSNs learn generalisations across syntactic constituents. ","Title: Natural Language Grammatical Inference with Recurrent Neural Networks  
Abstract: This paper examines the inductive inference of a complex grammar with neural networks specifically, the task considered is that of training a network to classify natural language sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical, thereby exhibiting the same kind of discriminatory power provided by the Principles and Parameters linguistic framework, or Government-and-Binding theory. Neural networks are trained, without the division into learned vs. innate components assumed by Chomsky, in an attempt to produce the same judgments as native speakers on sharply grammatical/ungrammatical data. How a recurrent neural network could possess linguistic capability, and the properties of various common recurrent neural network architectures are discussed. The problem exhibits training behavior which is often not present with smaller grammars, and training was initially difficult. However, after implementing several techniques aimed at improving the convergence of the gradient descent backpropagation-through- time training algorithm, significant learning was possible. It was found that certain architectures are better able to learn an appropriate grammar. The operation of the networks and their training is analyzed. Finally, the extraction of rules in the form of deterministic finite state automata is investigated. ",1
"Title: BOOSTING AND NAIVE BAYESIAN LEARNING  
Abstract: Although so-called naive Bayesian classification makes the unrealistic assumption that the values of the attributes of an example are independent given the class of the example, this learning method is remarkably successful in practice, and no uniformly better learning method is known. Boosting is a general method of combining multiple classifiers due to Yoav Freund and Rob Schapire. This paper shows that boosting applied to naive Bayesian classifiers yields combination classifiers that are representationally equivalent to standard feedforward multilayer perceptrons. (An ancillary result is that naive Bayesian classification is a nonparametric, nonlinear generalization of logistic regression.) As a training algorithm, boosted naive Bayesian learning is quite different from backpropagation, and has definite advantages. Boosting requires only linear time and constant space, and hidden nodes are learned incrementally, starting with the most important. On the real-world datasets on which the method has been tried so far, generalization performance is as good as or better than the best published result using any other learning method. Unlike all other standard learning algorithms, naive Bayesian learning, with and without boosting, can be done in logarithmic time with a linear number of parallel computing units. Accordingly, these learning methods are highly plausible computationally as models of animal learning. Other arguments suggest that they are plausible behaviorally also. ","Title: Beyond Independence: Conditions for the Optimality of the Simple Bayesian Classifier  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC) is commonly thought to assume that attributes are independent given the class, but this is apparently contradicted by the surprisingly good performance it exhibits in many domains that contain clear attribute dependences. No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this finding lies in the distinction between classification and probability estimation: correct classification can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several sufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. The paper also reports empirical evidence of the SBC's competitive performance in domains containing substantial degrees of attribute dependence. ",1
"Title: Application of Neural Networks for the Classification of Diffuse Liver Disease by Quantitative Echography  
Abstract: Three different methods were investigated to determine their ability to detect and classify various categories of diffuse liver disease. A statistical method, i.e., discriminant analysis, a supervised neural network called backpropagation and a nonsupervised, self-organizing feature map were examined. The investigation was performed on the basis of a previously selected set of acoustic and image texture parameters. The limited number of patients was successfully extended by generating additional but independent data with identical statistical properties. The generated data were used for training and test sets. The final test was made with the original patient data as a validation set. It is concluded that neural networks are an attractive alternative to traditional statistical techniques when dealing with medical detection and classification tasks. Moreover, the use of generated data for training the networks and the discriminant classifier has been shown to be justified and profitable. ","Title: Cholinergic suppression of transmission may allow combined associative memory function and self-organization in the neocortex.  
Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.",1
"Title: Adaptive tuning of numerical weather prediction models: Randomized GCV in three and four dimensional data assimilation  
Abstract: This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.","Title: Adaptive Tuning of Numerical Weather Prediction Models: Simultaneous Estimation of Weighting, Smoothing and Physical Parameters 1  
Abstract: In recent years, case-based reasoning has been demonstrated to be highly useful for problem solving in complex domains. Also, mixed paradigm approaches emerged for combining CBR and induction techniques aiming at verifying the knowledge and/or building an efficient case memory. However, in complex domains induction over the whole problem space is often not possible or too time consuming. In this paper, an approach is presented which (owing to a close interaction with the CBR part) attempts to induce rules only for a particular context, i.e. for a problem just being solved by a CBR-oriented system. These rules may then be used for indexing purposes or similarity assessment in order to support the CBR process in the future. ",1
"Title: on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples  
Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.","Title: Prototype and Feature Selection by Sampling and Random Mutation Hill Climbing Algorithms  
Abstract: With the goal of reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy, we describe two algorithms to find sets of prototypes for nearest neighbor classification. Here, the term prototypes refers to the reference instances used in a nearest neighbor computation the instances with respect to which similarity is assessed in order to assign a class to a new data item. Both algorithms rely on stochastic techniques to search the space of sets of prototypes and are simple to implement. The first is a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm; the second applies random mutation hill climbing. On four datasets we show that only three or four prototypes sufficed to give predictive accuracy equal or superior to a basic nearest neighbor algorithm whose run-time storage costs were approximately 10 to 200 times greater. We briefly investigate how random mutation hill climbing may be applied to select features and prototypes simultaneously. Finally, we explain the performance of the sampling algorithm on these datasets in terms of a statistical measure of the extent of clustering displayed by the target classes.",1
"Title: Reinforcement Learning Methods for Continuous-Time Markov Decision Problems  
Abstract: Semi-Markov Decision Problems are continuous time generalizations of discrete time Markov Decision Problems. A number of reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed recently for the solution of Markov Decision Problems, based on the ideas of asynchronous dynamic programming and stochastic approximation. Among these are TD(), Q-learning, and Real-time Dynamic Programming. After reviewing semi-Markov Decision Problems and Bellman's optimality equation in that context, we propose algorithms similar to those named above, adapted to the solution of semi-Markov Decision Problems. We demonstrate these algorithms by applying them to the problem of determining the optimal control for a simple queueing system. We conclude with a discussion of circumstances under which these algorithms may be usefully ap plied.","Title: Machine Learning Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences Keywords: Incremental learning, prediction,
Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",1
"Title: Case-Based Acquisition of Place Knowledge  
Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. The framework represents distinct places using evidence grids, a probabilistic description of occupancy. Place recognition relies on case-based classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translations. The learning mechanism is also similar to that in case-based systems, involving the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. Experimental studies with both physical and simulated robots suggest that this approach improves place recognition with experience, that it can handle significant sensor noise, and that it scales well to increasing numbers of places. Previous researchers have studied evidence grids and place learning, but they have not combined these two powerful concepts, nor have they used the experimental methods of machine learning to evaluate their methods' abilities. ","Title: Exploration and Model Building in Mobile Robot Domains  
Abstract: I present first results on COLUMBUS, an autonomous mobile robot. COLUMBUS operates in initially unknown, structured environments. Its task is to explore and model the environment efficiently while avoiding collisions with obstacles. COLUMBUS uses an instance-based learning technique for modeling its environment. Real-world experiences are generalized via two artificial neural networks that encode the characteristics of the robot's sensors, as well as the characteristics of typical environments the robot is assumed to face. Once trained, these networks allow for knowledge transfer across different environments the robot will face over its lifetime. COLUMBUS' models represent both the expected reward and the confidence in these expectations. Exploration is achieved by navigating to low confidence regions. An efficient dynamic programming method is employed in background to find minimal-cost paths that, executed by the robot, maximize exploration. COLUMBUS operates in real-time. It has been operating successfully in an office building environment for periods up to hours.",1
"Title: Belief Maintenance in Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: Two issues of an intelligent navigation robot have been addressed in this work. First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.","Title: Belief Maintenance with Probabilistic Logic  
Abstract: We present a framework for learning DFA from simple examples. We show that efficient PAC learning of DFA is possible if the class of distributions is restricted to simple distributions where a teacher might choose examples based on the knowledge of the target concept. This answers an open research question posed in Pitt's seminal paper: Are DFA's PAC-identifiable if examples are drawn from the uniform distribution, or some other known simple distribution? Our approach uses the RPNI algorithm for learning DFA from labeled examples. In particular, we describe an efficient learning algorithm for exact learning of the target DFA with high probability when a bound on the number of states (N ) of the target DFA is known in advance. When N is not known, we show how this algorithm can be used for efficient PAC learning of DFAs. ",1

Harvey, eds., MIT Press. pp 358-367. knowledge into the program, which would result in familiar structures, we provided the algorithm with a model of the physical reality and a purely utilitarian fitness function, thus supplying measures of feasibility and functionality. In this way the evolutionary process runs in an environment that has not been unnecessarily constrained. We added, however, a requirement of computability to reject overly complex structures when they took too long for our simulations to evaluate. The results are encouraging. The evolved structures had a surprisingly alien look: they are not based in common knowledge on how to build with brick toys; instead, the computer found ways of its own through the evolutionary search process. We were able to assemble the final designs manually and confirm that they accomplish the objectives introduced with our fitness functions. After some background on related problems, we describe our physical simulation model for two-dimensional Lego structures, and the representation for encoding them and applying evolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of our work with photos of actual objects which were the result of particular optimizations. Finally, we discuss future work and draw some conclusions. In order to evolve both the morphology and behavior of autonomous mechanical devices which can be manufactured, one must have a simulator which operates under several constraints, and a resultant controller which is adaptive enough to cover the gap between simulated and real world. eral space of mechanisms. Conservative - because simulation is never perfect, it should preserve a margin of safety. Efficient - it should be quicker to test in simulation than through physical production and test. Buildable - results should be convertible from a simula tion to a real object Computer Evolution of Buildable Objects Abstract The idea of co-evolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has been constrained by the reality gap which implies that resultant objects are usually not buildable. The work we present takes a step in the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of parts. Evolution takes place in a simulator we designed, which computes forces and stresses and predicts failure for 2-dimensional Lego structures. The final printout of our program is a schematic assembly, which can then be built physically. We demonstrate its functionality in several different evolved entities.","Title: A Hybrid GP/GA Approach for Co-evolving Controllers and Robot Bodies to Achieve Fitness-Specified Tasks  
Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have been advocated to automate robot design. Some research work has shown the success of evolving controllers for the robots by genetic approaches. As we can observe, however, not only the controller but also the robot body itself can affect the behavior of the robot in a robot system. In this paper, we develop a hybrid GP/GA approach to evolve both controllers and robot bodies to achieve behavior-specified tasks. In order to assess the performance of the developed approach, it is used to evolve a simulated agent, with its own controller and body, to do obstacle avoidance in the simulated environment. Experimental results show the promise of this work. In addition, the importance of co-evolving controllers and robot bodies is analyzed and discussed in this paper. ",1
"Title: A comparison of the fixed and floating building block representation in the genetic algorithm  
Abstract: This article compares the traditional, fixed problem representation style of a genetic algorithm (GA) with a new floating representation in which the building blocks of a problem are not fixed at specific locations on the individuals of the population. In addition, the effects of non-coding segments on both of these representations is studied. Non-coding segments are a computational model of non-coding DNA and floating building blocks mimic the location independence of genes. The fact that these structures are prevalent in natural genetic systems suggests that they may provide some advantages to the evolutionary process. Our results show that there is a significant difference in how GAs solve a problem in the fixed and floating representations. GAs are able to maintain a more diverse population with the floating representation. The combination of non-coding segments and floating building blocks appears to encourage a GA to take advantage of its parallel search and recombination abilities. ","Title: Duplication of Coding Segments in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: Research into the utility of non-coding segments, or introns, in genetic-based encodings has shown that they expedite the evolution of solutions in domains by protecting building blocks against destructive crossover. We consider a genetic programming system where non-coding segments can be removed, and the resultant chromosomes returned into the population. This parsimonious repair leads to premature convergence, since as we remove the naturally occurring non-coding segments, we strip away their protective backup feature. We then duplicate the coding segments in the repaired chromosomes, and place the modified chromosomes into the population. The duplication method significantly improves the learning rate in the domain we have considered. We also show that this method can be applied to other domains.",1
"Title: Cooperative Case-Based Reasoning  
Abstract: We are investigating possible modes of cooperation among homogeneous agents with learning capabilities. In this paper we will be focused on agents that learn and solve problems using Case-based Reasoning (CBR), and we will present two modes of cooperation among them: Distributed Case-based Reasoning (DistCBR) and Collective Case-based Reasoning (ColCBR). We illustrate these modes with an application where different CBR agents able to recommend chromatography techniques for protein purification cooperate. The approach taken is to extend Noos, the representation language being used by the CBR agents. Noos is knowledge modeling framework designed to integrate learning methods and based on the task/method decomposition principle. The extension we present, Plural Noos, allows communication and cooperation among agents implemented in Noos by means of three basic constructs: alien references, foreign method evaluation, and mobile methods.","Title: (1994); Case-Based Reasoning: Foundational Issues, Methodological Variations, and System Approaches.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a recent approach to problem solving and learning that has got a lot of attention over the last few years. Originating in the US, the basic idea and underlying theories have spread to other continents, and we are now within a period of highly active research in case-based reasoning in Europe, as well. This paper gives an overview of the foundational issues related to case-based reasoning, describes some of the leading methodological approaches within the field, and exemplifies the current state through pointers to some systems. Initially, a general framework is defined, to which the subsequent descriptions and discussions will refer. The framework is influenced by recent methodologies for knowledge level descriptions of intelligent systems. The methods for case retrieval, reuse, solution testing, and learning are summarized, and their actual realization is discussed in the light of a few example systems that represent different CBR approaches. We also discuss the role of case-based methods as one type of reasoning and learning method within an integrated system architecture. ",1

Abstract: We study task sequences that allow for speeding up the learner's average reward intake through appropriate shifts of inductive bias (changes of the learner's policy). To evaluate long-term effects of bias shifts setting the stage for later bias shifts we use the ""success-story algorithm"" (SSA). SSA is occasionally called at times that may depend on the policy itself. It uses backtracking to undo those bias shifts that have not been empirically observed to trigger long-term reward accelerations (measured up until the current SSA call). Bias shifts that survive SSA represent a lifelong success history. Until the next SSA call, they are considered useful and build the basis for additional bias shifts. SSA allows for plugging in a wide variety of learning algorithms. We plug in (1) a novel, adaptive extension of Levin search and (2) a method for embedding the learner's policy modification strategy within the policy itself (incremental self-improvement). Our inductive transfer case studies involve complex, partially observable environments where traditional reinforcement learning fails. ",1
"Title: Theory Refinement Combining Analytical and Empirical Methods  
Abstract: This article describes a comprehensive approach to automatic theory revision. Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory. The system has been tested in a variety of application domains, and results are presented for problems in the domains of molecular biology and plant disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The problem of learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables is known to be a hard problem. Even the simpler task of learning just the conditional probabilities on a Bayesian network with hidden variables is hard. In this paper, we present an approach that learns the conditional probabilities on a Bayesian network with hidden variables by transforming it into a multi-layer feedforward neural network (ANN). The conditional probabilities are mapped onto weights in the ANN, which are then learned using standard backpropagation techniques. To avoid the problem of exponentially large ANNs, we focus on Bayesian networks with noisy-or and noisy-and nodes. Experiments on real world classification problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique. ",1

Abstract: We present an algorithm for improving the accuracy of algorithms for learning binary concepts. The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire in his paper ""The strength of weak learnability"", and represents an improvement over his results. The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant's polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances. ",1
"Title: Cryptographic Limitations on Learning Boolean Formulae and Finite Automata  
Abstract: In this paper we prove the intractability of learning several classes of Boolean functions in the distribution-free model (also called the Probably Approximately Correct or PAC model) of learning from examples. These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography.

"Title: Structured Representation of Complex Stochastic Systems  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of representing complex systems that evolve stochastically over time. Dynamic Bayesian networks provide a compact representation for stochastic processes. Unfortunately, they are often unwieldy since they cannot explicitly model the complex organizational structure of many real life systems: the fact that processes are typically composed of several interacting subprocesses, each of which can, in turn, be further decomposed. We propose a hierarchically structured representation language which extends both dynamic Bayesian networks and the object-oriented Bayesian network framework of [9], and show that our language allows us to describe such systems in a natural and modular way. Our language supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. For example, it allows us to represent systems where some processes evolve at a different rate than others, or systems where the processes interact only intermittently. We provide a simple inference mechanism for our representation via translation to Bayesian networks, and suggest ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in our representation. ","Title: Factorial Hidden Markov Models  
Abstract: One of the basic probabilistic tools used for time series modeling is the hidden Markov model (HMM). In an HMM, information about the past of the time series is conveyed through a single discrete variable|the hidden state. We present a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. Both inference and learning in this model depend critically on computing the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations. We present an exact algorithm for inference in this model, and relate it to the Forward-Backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general belief networks. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or mean field theory. We also present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, based on which we derive a tractable learning algorithm. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that it outperforms HMMs in capturing the complex temporal patterns in this dataset.",1
"Title: Evolution of Non-Deterministic Incremental Algorithms as a New Approach for Search in State Spaces  
Abstract: Let us call a non-deterministic incremental algorithm one that is able to construct any solution to a combinatorial problem by selecting incrementally an ordered sequence of choices that defines this solution, each choice being made non-deterministically. In that case, the state space can be represented as a tree, and a solution is a path from the root of that tree to a leaf. This paper describes how the simulated evolution of a population of such non-deterministic incremental algorithms offers a new approach for the exploration of a state space, compared to other techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Strategies (ES) or Hill Climbing. In particular, the efficiency of this method, implemented as the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model, is presented for the sorting network problem, a reference problem that has challenged computer science. Then, we shall show that the END model remedies some drawbacks of these optimization techniques and even outperforms them for this problem. Indeed, some 16-input sorting networks as good as the best known have been built from scratch, and even a 25-year-old result for the 13-input problem has been improved by one comparator.","Title: A Stochastic Search Approach to Grammar Induction  
Abstract: This paper describes a new sampling-based heuristic for tree search named SAGE and presents an analysis of its performance on the problem of grammar induction. This last work has been inspired by the Abbadingo DFA learning competition [14] which took place between Mars and November 1997. SAGE ended up as one of the two winners in that competition. The second winning algorithm, first proposed by Rod-ney Price, implements a new evidence-driven heuristic for state merging. Our own version of this heuristic is also described in this paper and compared to SAGE.",1
"Title: On the Complexity of Solving Markov Decision Problems  
Abstract: Markov decision problems (MDPs) provide the foundations for a number of problems of interest to AI researchers studying automated planning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we summarize results regarding the complexity of solving MDPs and the running time of MDP solution algorithms. We argue that, although MDPs can be solved efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical algorithms for solving large problems quickly. To encourage future research, we sketch some alternative methods of analysis that rely on the struc ture of MDPs.","Title: The Parti-game Algorithm for Variable Resolution Reinforcement Learning in Multidimensional State-spaces  
Abstract: Parti-game is a new algorithm for learning feasible trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional continuous state-spaces. In high dimensions it is essential that learning does not plan uniformly over a state-space. Parti-game maintains a decision-tree partitioning of state-space and applies techniques from game-theory and computational geometry to efficiently and adaptively concentrate high resolution only on critical areas. The current version of the algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spaces. Future versions will be designed to find a solution that optimizes a real-valued criterion. Many simulated problems have been tested, ranging from two-dimensional to nine-dimensional state-spaces, including mazes, path planning, non-linear dynamics, and planar snake robots in restricted spaces. In all cases, a good solution is found in less than ten trials and a few minutes. ",1

","Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples  
Abstract: This paper describes the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME), a program for studying analogical processing. SME has been built to explore Gentner's Structure-mapping theory of analogy, and provides a ""tool kit"" for constructing matching algorithms consistent with this theory. Its flexibility enhances cognitive simulation studies by simplifying experimentation. Furthermore, SME is very efficient, making it a useful component in machine learning systems as well. We review the Structure-mapping theory and describe the design of the engine. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm, and demonstrate that most of the steps are polynomial, typically bounded by O (N 2 ). Next we demonstrate some examples of its operation taken from our cognitive simulation studies and work in machine learning. Finally, we compare SME to other analogy programs and discuss several areas for future work. This paper appeared in Artificial Intelligence, 41, 1989, pp 1-63.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of graphs as a mathematical tool for expressing independenices, and as a formal language for communicating and processing causal information in statistical analysis. We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation. We exemplify the tradeoffs between the two approaches by deriving nonparametric bounds on treatment effects under conditions of imperfect compliance. ",1
"Title: A comparison of Anapron with seven other name-pronunciation systems  
Abstract: This paper presents an experiment comparing a new name-pronunciation system, Anapron, with seven existing systems: three state-of-the-art commercial systems (from Bellcore, Bell Labs, and DEC), two variants of a machine-learning system (NETtalk), and two humans. Anapron works by combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. It is based on the idea that it is much easier to improve a rule-based system by adding case-based reasoning to it than by tuning the rules to deal with every exception. In the experiment described here, Anapron used a set of rules adapted from MITalk and elementary foreign-language textbooks, and a case library of 5000 names. With these components | which required relatively little knowledge engineering | Anapron was found to perform almost at the level of the commercial systems, and significantly better than the two versions of NETtalk.

","Title: A Comparative Study of ID3 and Backpropagation for English Text-to-Speech Mapping  
Abstract: The performance of the error backpropagation (BP) and ID3 learning algorithms was compared on the task of mapping English text to phonemes and stresses. Under the distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, it is shown that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task by several percentage points. Three hypotheses explaining this difference were explored: (a) ID3 is overfitting the training data, (b) BP is able to share hidden units across several output units and hence can learn the output units better, and (c) BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not. We conclude that only hypothesis (c) is correct. By augmenting ID3 with a simple statistical learning procedure, the performance of BP can be approached but not matched. More complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP and ID3 substantially. A study of the residual errors suggests that there is still substantial room for improvement in learning methods for text-to-speech mapping.",1
"Title: Learning Viewpoint Invariant Representations of Faces in an Attractor Network  
Abstract: In natural visual experience, different views of an object tend to appear in close temporal proximity as an animal manipulates the object or navigates around it. We investigated the ability of an attractor network to acquire view invariant visual representations by associating first neighbors in a pattern sequence. The pattern sequence contains successive views of faces of ten individuals as they change pose. Under the network dynamics developed by Griniasty, Tsodyks & Amit (1993), multiple views of a given subject fall into the same basin of attraction. We use an independent component (ICA) representation of the faces for the input patterns (Bell & Sejnowski, 1995). The ICA representation has advantages over the principal component representation (PCA) for viewpoint-invariant recognition both with and without the attractor network, suggesting that ICA is a better representation than PCA for object recognition. ","Title: An information-maximisation approach to blind separation and blind deconvolution  
Abstract: We derive a new self-organising learning algorithm which maximises the information transferred in a network of non-linear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisation of Principal Components Analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to ten speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information max-imisation provides a unifying framework for problems in `blind' signal processing. fl Please send comments to tony@salk.edu.

"Title: Nonlinear gated experts for time series: discovering regimes and avoiding overfitting  
Abstract: In: International Journal of Neural Systems 6 (1995) p. 373 - 399. URL of this paper: ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z, or http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~andreas/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z University of Colorado Computer Science Technical Report CU-CS-798-95. In the analysis and prediction of real-world systems, two of the key problems are nonstationarity(often in the form of switching between regimes), and overfitting (particularly serious for noisy processes). This article addresses these problems using gated experts, consisting of a (nonlinear) gating network, and several (also nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns to predict the conditional mean, and each expert adapts its width to match the noise level in its regime. The gating network learns to predict the probability of each expert, given the input. This article focuses on the case where the gating network bases its decision on information from the inputs. This can be contrasted to hidden Markov models where the decision is based on the previous state(s) (i.e., on the output of the gating network at the previous time step), as well as to averaging over several predictors. In contrast, gated experts soft-partition the input space. This article discusses the underlying statistical assumptions, derives the weight update rules, and compares the performance of gated experts to standard methods on three time series: (1) a computer-generated series, obtained by randomly switching between two nonlinear processes, (2) a time series from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition (the light intensity of a laser in chaotic state), and (3) the daily electricity demand of France, a real-world multivariate problem with structure on several time scales. The main results are (1) the gating network correctly discovers the different regimes of the process, (2) the widths associated with each expert are important for the segmentation task (and they can be used to characterize the sub-processes), and (3) there is less overfitting compared to single networks (homogeneous multi-layer perceptrons), since the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels. This can be viewed as matching the local complexity of the model to the local complexity of the data. ","Title: Segmenting Time Series using Gated Experts with Simulated Annealing  
Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.",1

Abstract: We discuss a Bayesian formalism which gives rise to a type of wavelet threshold estimation in non-parametric regression. A prior distribution is imposed on the wavelet coefficients of the unknown response function, designed to capture the sparseness of wavelet expansion common to most applications. For the prior specified, the posterior median yields a thresholding procedure. Our prior model for the underlying function can be adjusted to give functions falling in any specific Besov space. We establish a relation between the hyperparameters of the prior model and the parameters of those Besov spaces within which realizations from the prior will fall. Such a relation gives insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters. Moreover, the established relation makes it possible in principle to incorporate prior knowledge about the function's regularity properties into the prior model for its wavelet coefficients. However, prior knowledge about a function's regularity properties might be hard to elicit; with this in mind, we propose a standard choise of prior hyperparameters that works well in our examples. Several simulated examples are used to illustrate our method, and comparisons are made with other thresholding methods. We also present an application to a data set collected in an anaesthesiological study. ",1
"Title: Learning networks for face analysis and synthesis  
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the face-related projects in our group. The unifying theme underlying our work is the use of example-based learning methods for both analyzing and synthesizing face images. We label the example face images (and for the problem of face detection, ""near miss"" faces as well) with descriptive parameters for pose, expression, identity, and face vs. non-face. Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ","Title: Priors, Stabilizers and Basis Functions: from regularization to radial, tensor and additive splines  
Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular we had discussed how standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well-known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. In this paper we show that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same extension that leads from Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions and some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In the final part of the paper, we show the relation between activation functions of the Gaussian and sigmoidal type by considering the simple case of the kernel G(x) = jxj. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that generalize into Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that generalize into schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and one-hidden-layer perceptrons.

Abstract: In Proceedings of the 18th Annual Cognitive Science Conference, San Diego, CA, July 1996 This paper can also be found at the Georgia Tech WWW site: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/cogsci/ Abstract Successful creative understanding requires that a reasoner be able to manipulate known concepts in order to understand novel ones. A major problem arises, however, when one considers exactly how these manipulations are to be bounded. If a bound is imposed which is too loose, the reasoner is likely to create bizarre understandings rather than useful creative ones. On the other hand, if the bound is too tight, the reasoner will not have the flexibility needed to deal with a wide range of creative understanding experiences. Our approach is to make use of a principled ontology as one source of reasonable bounding. This allows our creative understanding theory to have good explanatory power about the process while allowing the computer implementation of the theory (the ISAAC system) to be flexible without being bizarre in the task domain of reading science fiction short stories.

"Title: An Analysis of Bayesian Classifiers (1988), involves the formulation of average-case models for specific algorithms
Abstract: In this paper we present an average-case analysis of the Bayesian classifier, a simple induction algorithm that fares remarkably well on many learning tasks. Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for artificial domains, and give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning. One goal of research in machine learning is to discover principles that relate algorithms and domain characteristics to behavior. To this end, many researchers have carried out systematic experimentation with natural and artificial domains in search of empirical regularities (e.g., Kibler & Langley, 1988). Others have focused on theoretical analyses, often within the paradigm of probably approximately correct learning (e.g., Haus-sler, 1990). However, most experimental studies are based only on informal analyses of the learning task, whereas most formal analyses address the worst case, and thus bear little relation to empirical results. ber of attributes, and the class and attribute frequencies, they obtain predictions about the behavior of induction algorithms and used experiments to check their analyses. 1 However, their research does not focus on algorithms typically used by the experimental and practical sides of machine learning, and it is important that average-case analyses be extended to such methods. Recently, there has been growing interest in probabilistic approaches to inductive learning. For example, Fisher (1987) has described Cobweb, an incremental algorithm for conceptual clustering that draws heavily on Bayesian ideas, and the literature reports a number of systems that build on this work (e.g., Allen & Lang-ley, 1990; Iba & Gennari, 1991; Thompson & Langley, 1991). Cheeseman et al. (1988) have outlined Auto-Class, a nonincremental system that uses Bayesian methods to cluster instances into groups, and other researchers have focused on the induction of Bayesian inference networks (e.g., Cooper & Kerskovits, 1991). These recent Bayesian learning algorithms are complex and not easily amenable to analysis, but they share a common ancestor that is simpler and more tractable. This supervised algorithm, which we refer to simply as a Bayesian classifier, comes originally from work in pattern recognition (Duda & Hart, 1973). The method stores a probabilistic summary for each class; this summary contains the conditional probability of each attribute value given the class, as well as the probability (or base rate) of the class. This data structure approximates the representational power of a perceptron; it describes a single decision boundary through the instance space. When the algorithm encounters a new instance, it updates the probabilities stored with the specified class. Neither the order of training instances nor the occurrence of classification errors have any effect on this process. When given a test instance, the classifier uses an evaluation function (which we describe in detail later) to rank the alter ","Title: A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection  
Abstract: We review accuracy estimation methods and compare the two most common methods: cross-validation and bootstrap. Recent experimental results on artificial data and theoretical results in restricted settings have shown that for selecting a good classifier from a set of classifiers (model selection), ten-fold cross-validation may be better than the more expensive leave-one-out cross-validation. We report on a large-scale experiment|over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm|to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algorithms on real-world datasets. For cross-validation, we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not; for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, the best method to use for model selection is ten-fold stratified cross validation, even if computation power allows using more folds.

Theoretical results suggest that, from the view of hyperplane sampling disruption, uniform crossover has few redeeming features. However, a growing body of experimental evidence suggests otherwise. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these opposing views of uniform crossover and present a framework for understanding its virtues.","Title: Distribution Category:  A Parallel Genetic Algorithm for the Set Partitioning Problem

These trading rules are then used on out-of-sample data, to demonstrate that they can profit from the SMFM model, to illustrate that these markets are likely not efficient. ",1
"Title: Sampling from Multimodal Distributions Using Tempered Transitions  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 9421, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently-developed method of ""simulated tempering"", the ""tempered transition"" method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that unfortunately is cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are ""deceptive"". ","Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice: A Roundtable Discussion  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods make possible the use of flexible Bayesian models that would otherwise be computationally infeasible. In recent years, a great variety of such applications have been described in the literature. Applied statisticians who are new to these methods may have several questions and concerns, however: How much effort and expertise are needed to design and use a Markov chain sampler? How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various ""tricks of the trade"". This paper is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC and to not-so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding convergence, assessing standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development.

This paper summarizes our previous work on formulating this task for solution by the reinforcement learning algorithm T D(). A shortcoming of this previous work was its reliance on hand-engineered input features. This paper shows how to extend the time-delay neural network (TDNN) architecture to apply it to irregular-length schedules. Experimental tests show that this TDNN-T D() network can match the performance of our previous hand-engineered system. The tests also show that both neural network approaches significantly outperform the best previous (non-learning) solution to this problem in terms of the quality of the resulting schedules and the number of search steps required to construct them.","Title: Machine Learning Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences Keywords: Incremental learning, prediction,
Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",1

Abstract: This paper describes preliminary work that aims to apply some learning strategies to a medical follow-up study. An investigation of the application of three machine learning algorithms-1R, FOIL and InductH to identify risk factors that govern the colposuspension cure rate has been made. The goal of this study is to induce a generalised description or explanation of the classification attribute, colposuspension cure rate (completely cured, improved, unchanged and worse) from the 767 examples in the questionnaires. We looked for a set of rules that described which risk factors result in differences of cure rate. The results were encouraging, and indicate that machine learning can play a useful role in large scale medical problem solving. ","Title: Quinlan, 1990 J.R. Quinlan.

Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.",1
"Title: Models of Parallel Adaptive Logic  
Abstract: This paper overviews a proposed architecture for adaptive parallel logic referred to as ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System). The ASOCS approach is based on an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements which operate in a parallel asynchronous fashion. Problem specification is given to the system by presenting if-then rules in the form of boolean conjunctions. Rules are added incrementally and the system adapts to the changing rule-base. Adaptation and data processing form two separate phases of operation. During processing the system acts as a parallel hardware circuit. The adaptation process is distributed amongst the computing elements and efficiently exploits parallelism. Adaptation is done in a self-organizing fashion and takes place in time linear with the depth of the network. This paper summarizes the overall ASOCS concept and overviews three specific architectures. ","Title: Digital Neural Networks  
Abstract: Demands for applications requiring massive parallelism in symbolic environments have given rebirth to research in models labeled as neura l networks. These models are made up of many simple nodes which are highly interconnected such that computation takes place as data flows amongst the nodes of the network. To present, most models have proposed nodes based on simple analog functions, where inputs are multiplied by weights and summed, the total then optionally being transformed by an arbitrary function at the node. Learning in these systems is accomplished by adjusting the weights on the input lines. This paper discusses the use of digital (boolean) nodes as a primitive building block in connectionist systems. Digital nodes naturally engender new paradigms and mechanisms for learning and processing in connectionist networks. The digital nodes are used as the basic building block of a class of models called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems). These models combine massive parallelism with the ability to adapt in a self-organizing fashion. Basic features of standard neural network learning algorithms and those proposed using digital nodes are compared and contrasted. The latter mechanisms can lead to vastly improved efficiency for many applications. ",1

Abstract:  ","Title: Using Precepts to Augment Training Set Learning an input whose value is don't-care in some
Abstract: are used in turn to approximate A. Empirical studies show that good results can be achieved with TSL [8, 11]. However, TSL has several drawbacks. Training set learners (e.g., backpropagation) are typically slow as they may require many passes over the training set. Also, there is no guarantee that, given an arbitrary training set, the system will find enough good critical features to get a reasonable approximation of A. Moreover, the number of features to be searched is exponential in the number of inputs, and TSL becomes computationally expensive [1]. Finally, the scarcity of interesting positive theoretical results suggests the difficulty of learning without sufficient a priori knowledge. The goal of learning systems is to generalize. Generalization is commonly based on the set of critical features the system has available. Training set learners typically extract critical features from a random set of examples. While this approach is attractive, it suffers from the exponential growth of the number of features to be searched. We propose to extend it by endowing the system with some a priori knowledge, in the form of precepts. Advantages of the augmented system are speedup, improved generalization, and greater parsimony. This paper presents a precept-driven learning algorithm. Its main features include: 1) distributed implementation, 2) bounded learning and execution times, and 3) ability to handle both correct and incorrect precepts. Results of simulations on real-world data demonstrate promise. This paper presents precept-driven learning (PDL). PDL is intended to overcome some of TSL's weaknesses. In PDL, the training set is augmented by a small set of precepts. A pair p = (i, o) in I O is called an example. A precept is an example in which some of the i-entries (inputs) are set to the special value don't-care. An input whose value is not don't-care is said to be asserted. If i has no effect on the value of the output. The use of the special value don't-care is therefore as a shorthand. A pair containing don't-care inputs represents as many examples as the product of the sizes of the input domains of its don't-care inputs. 1. Introduction ",1
"Title: database  
Abstract: MIT Computational Cognitive Science Technical Report 9701 Abstract We describe variational approximation methods for efficient probabilistic reasoning, applying these methods to the problem of diagnostic inference in the QMR-DT database. The QMR-DT database is a large-scale belief network based on statistical and expert knowledge in internal medicine. The size and complexity of this network render exact probabilistic diagnosis infeasible for all but a small set of cases. This has hindered the development of the QMR- DT network as a practical diagnostic tool and has hindered researchers from exploring and critiquing the diagnostic behavior of QMR. In this paper we describe how variational approximation methods can be applied to the QMR network, resulting in fast diagnostic inference. We evaluate the accuracy of our methods on a set of standard diagnostic cases and compare to stochastic sampling methods.

"Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We describe an ongoing project to develop an adaptive training system (ATS) that dynamically models a students learning processes and can provide specialized tutoring adapted to a students knowledge state and learning style. The student modeling component of the ATS, ML-Modeler, uses machine learning (ML) techniques to emulate the students novice-to-expert transition. ML-Modeler infers which learning methods the student has used to reach the current knowledge state by comparing the students solution trace to an expert solution and generating plausible hypotheses about what misconceptions and errors the student has made. A case-based approach is used to generate hypotheses through incorrectly applying analogy, overgeneralization, and overspecialization. The student and expert models use a network-based representation that includes abstract concepts and relationships as well as strategies for problem solving. Fuzzy methods are used to represent the uncertainty in the student model. This paper describes the design of the ATS and ML-Modeler, and gives a detailed example of how the system would model and tutor the student in a typical session. The domain we use for this example is high-school level chemistry. ","Title: Representing Self-knowledge for Introspection about Memory Search  
Abstract: This position paper sketches a framework for modeling introspective reasoning and discusses the relevance of that framework for modeling introspective reasoning about memory search. It argues that effective and flexible memory processing in rich memories should be built on five types of explicitly represented self-knowledge: knowledge about information needs, relationships between different types of information, expectations for the actual behavior of the information search process, desires for its ideal behavior, and representations of how those expectations and desires relate to its actual performance. This approach to modeling memory search is both an illustration of general principles for modeling introspective reasoning and a step towards addressing the problem of how a reasoner human or machinecan acquire knowledge about the properties of its own knowledge base.

Abstract: Proben1 is a collection of problems for neural network learning in the realm of pattern classification and function approximation plus a set of rules and conventions for carrying out benchmark tests with these or similar problems. Proben1 contains 15 data sets from 12 different domains. All datasets represent realistic problems which could be called diagnosis tasks and all but one consist of real world data. The datasets are all presented in the same simple format, using an attribute representation that can directly be used for neural network training. Along with the datasets, Proben1 defines a set of rules for how to conduct and how to document neural network benchmarking. The purpose of the problem and rule collection is to give researchers easy access to data for the evaluation of their algorithms and networks and to make direct comparison of the published results feasible. This report describes the datasets and the benchmarking rules. It also gives some basic performance measures indicating the difficulty of the various problems. These measures can be used as baselines for comparison. ","Title: Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs  
Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt; 2 values (i.e., k ""classes""). The definition is acquired by studying large collections of training examples of the form hx i ; f(x i )i. Existing approaches to this problem include (a) direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and (c) application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output codes such as those employed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which BCH error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the performance of ID3 on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on an isolated-letter speech-recognition task. These results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems. ",1

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are very commonly used in Bayesian statistics for sampling from complicated, high-dimensional posterior distributions. A continuing source of uncertainty is how long such a sampler must be run in order to converge approximately to its target stationary distribution. Rosenthal (1995b) presents a method to compute rigorous theoretical upper bounds on the number of iterations required to achieve a specified degree of convergence in total variation distance by verifying drift and minorization conditions. We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in Rosenthal's theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it can not provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof. Acknowledgements.

"Title: Monte Carlo Implementation of Gaussian Process Models for Bayesian Regression and Classification  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 9702, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. Gaussian processes are a natural way of defining prior distributions over functions of one or more input variables. In a simple nonparametric regression problem, where such a function gives the mean of a Gaussian distribution for an observed response, a Gaussian process model can easily be implemented using matrix computations that are feasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases. Hyperparameters that define the covariance function of the Gaussian process can be sampled using Markov chain methods. Regression models where the noise has a t distribution and logistic or probit models for classification applications can be implemented by sampling as well for latent values underlying the observations. Software is now available that implements these methods using covariance functions with hierarchical parameterizations. Models defined in this way can discover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs are relevant to predicting the response. ","Title: Variational Gaussian Process Classifiers

Abstract: This thesis presents a machine learning model capable of extracting discrete classes out of continuous valued input features. This is done using a neurally inspired novel competitive classifier (CC) which feeds the discrete classifications forward to a supervised machine learning model. The supervised learning model uses the discrete classifications and perhaps other information available to solve a problem. The supervised learner then generates feedback to guide the CC into potentially more useful classifications of the continuous valued input features. Two supervised learning models are combined with the CC creating ASOCS-AFE and ID3-AFE. Both models are simulated and the results are analyzed. Based on these results, several areas of future research are proposed. ","Title: Priority ASOCS  ASOCS models have two significant advantages over other learning models:  
Abstract: This paper presents an ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System) model for massively parallel processing of incrementally defined rule systems in such areas as adaptive logic, robotics, logical inference, and dynamic control. An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. During learning mode, an ASOCS incorporates a rule expressed as a Boolean conjunction in a distributed fashion in time logarithmic in the number of rules. This paper proposes a learning algorithm and architecture for Priority ASOCS. This new ASOCS model uses rules with priorities. The new model has significant learning time and space complexity improvements over previous models. Non-von Neumann architectures such as neural networks attack the word-at-a-time bottleneck of traditional computing systems [1]. Neural networks learn input-output mappings using highly distributed processing and memory [10,11,12]. Their numerous simple processing elements with modifiable weighted links permit a high degree of parallelism. A typical neural network has fixed topology. It learns by modifying weighted links between nodes. A new class of connectionist architectures has been proposed called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) [4,5]. ASOCS models support efficient computation through self-organized learning and parallel execution. Learning is done through the incremental presentation of rules and/or examples. ASOCS models learn by modifying their topology. Data types include Boolean and multi-state variables; recent models support analog variables. The model incorporates rules into an adaptive logic network in a parallel and self organizing fashion. In processing mode, ASOCS supports fully parallel execution on actual inputs according to the learned rules. The adaptive logic network acts as a parallel hardware circuit during execution, mapping n input boolean vectors into m output boolean vectors, in a combinatoric fashion. The overall philosophy of ASOCS follows the high level goals of current neural network models. However, the mechanisms of learning and execution vary significantly. The ASOCS logic network is topologically dynamic with the network growing to efficiently fit the specific application. Current ASOCS models are based on digital nodes. ASOCS also supports use of symbolic and heuristic learning mechanisms, thus combining the parallelism and distributed nature of connectionist computing with the potential power of AI symbolic learning. A proof of concept ASOCS chip has been developed [2]. ",1
"Title: Simple Neuron Models for Independent Component Analysis  
Abstract: Recently, several neural algorithms have been introduced for Independent Component Analysis. Here we approach the problem from the point of view of a single neuron. First, simple Hebbian-like learning rules are introduced for estimating one of the independent components from sphered data. Some of the learning rules can be used to estimate an independent component which has a negative kurtosis, and the others estimate a component of positive kurtosis. Next, a two-unit system is introduced to estimate an independent component of any kurtosis. The results are then generalized to estimate independent components from non-sphered (raw) mixtures. To separate several independent components, a system of several neurons with linear negative feedback is used. The convergence of the learning rules is rigorously proven without any unnecessary hypotheses on the distributions of the independent components.","Title: One-unit Learning Rules for Independent Component Analysis

"Title: Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models  
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Marko-vian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.

Abstract: We have already shown that extracting long-term dependencies from sequential data is difficult, both for deterministic dynamical systems such as recurrent networks, and probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) or input/output hidden Markov models (IOHMMs). In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs. ",1

We develop a new approach, which is called polynomial explainability, that is shown to be useful for learning some new subclasses of DNF (and CNF) formulae that were not known to be learnable before. Unlike previous learnability results for DNF (and CNF) formulae, these subclasses are not limited in the number of terms or in the number of variables per term; yet, they contain the subclasses of k-DNF and k-term-DNF (and the corresponding classes of CNF) as special cases. We apply our DNF results to the problem of learning visual concepts and obtain learning algorithms for several natural subclasses of visual concepts that appear to have no natural boolean counterpart. On the other hand, we show that learning some other natural subclasses of visual concepts is as hard as learning the class of all DNF formulae.

Abstract: A novel method is proposed for combining multiple probabilistic classifiers on different feature sets. In order to achieve the improved classification performance, a generalized finite mixture model is proposed as a linear combination scheme and implemented based on radial basis function networks. In the linear combination scheme, soft competition on different feature sets is adopted as an automatic feature rank mechanism so that different feature sets can be always simultaneously used in an optimal way to determine linear combination weights. For training the linear combination scheme, a learning algorithm is developed based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method has been applied to a typical real world problem, viz. speaker identification, in which different feature sets often need consideration simultaneously for robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields good performance in speaker identification.","Title: Selection of Relevant Features and Examples in Machine Learning

"Title: Theory and Applications of Agnostic PAC-Learning with Small Decision Trees  
Abstract: We exhibit a theoretically founded algorithm T2 for agnostic PAC-learning of decision trees of at most 2 levels, whose computation time is almost linear in the size of the training set. We evaluate the performance of this learning algorithm T2 on 15 common real-world datasets, and show that for most of these datasets T2 provides simple decision trees with little or no loss in predictive power (compared with C4.5). In fact, for datasets with continuous attributes its error rate tends to be lower than that of C4.5. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a PAC-learning algorithm is shown to be applicable to real-world classification problems. Since one can prove that T2 is an agnostic PAC-learning algorithm, T2 is guaranteed to produce close to optimal 2-level decision trees from sufficiently large training sets for any (!) distribution of data. In this regard T2 differs strongly from all other learning algorithms that are considered in applied machine learning, for which no guarantee can be given about their performance on new datasets. We also demonstrate that this algorithm T2 can be used as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of the expressive limits of 2-level decision trees. Finally, T2, in combination with new bounds on the VC-dimension of decision trees of bounded depth that we derive, provides us now for the first time with the tools necessary for comparing learning curves of decision trees for real-world datasets with the theoretical estimates of PAC learning theory. ","Title: Learning Active Classifiers  
Abstract: Many classification algorithms are ""passive"", in that they assign a class-label to each instance based only on the description given, even if that description is incomplete. In contrast, an active classifier can | at some cost | obtain the values of missing attributes, before deciding upon a class label. The expected utility of using an active classifier depends on both the cost required to obtain the additional attribute values and the penalty incurred if it outputs the wrong classification. This paper considers the problem of learning near-optimal active classifiers, using a variant of the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) model. After defining the framework | which is perhaps the main contribution of this paper | we describe a situation where this task can be achieved efficiently, but then show that the task is often intractable.

"Title: AMASS: A Structured Pattern Matching Approach to Shotgun Sequence Assembly  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient, reliable shotgun sequence assembly algorithm based on a fingerprinting scheme that is robust to both noise and repetitive sequences in the data. Our algorithm uses exact matches of short patterns randomly selected from fragment data to identify fragment overlaps, construct an overlap map, and finally deliver a consensus sequence. We show how statistical clues made explicit in our approach can easily be exploited to correctly assemble results even in the presence of extensive repetitive sequences. Our approach is exceptionally fast in practice: e.g., we have successfully assembled a whole Mycoplasma genitalium genome (approximately 580 kbps) in roughly 8 minutes of 64MB 200MHz Pentium Pro CPU time from real shotgun data, where most existing algorithms can be expected to run for several hours to a day on the same data. Moreover, experiments with shotgun data synthetically prepared from real DNA sequences from a wide range of organisms (including human DNA) and containing extensive repeating regions demonstrate our algorithm's robustness to noise and the presence of repetitive sequences. For example, we have correctly assembled a 238kbp Human DNA sequence in less than 3 minutes of 64MB 200MHz Pentium Pro CPU time. fl Support for this research was provided in part by the Office of Naval Research through grant N0014-94-1-1178.","Title: A New Algorithm for DNA Sequence Assembly  Running Title: A New Algorithm for DNA Sequence Assembly

"Title: 3 Representation Issues in Neighborhood Search and Evolutionary Algorithms  
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms are often presented as general purpose search methods. Yet, we also know that no search method is better than another over all possible problems and that in fact there is often a good deal of problem specific information involved in the choice of problem representation and search operators. In this paper we explore some very general properties of representations as they relate to neighborhood search methods. In particular, we looked at the expected number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator when averaged overall possible representations. The number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator for standard Binary and standard binary reflected Gray codes is developed and explored as one measure of problem complexity. We also relate number of local optima to another metric, , designed to provide one measure of complexity with respect to a simple genetic algorithm. Choosing a good representation is a vital component of solving any search problem. However, choosing a good representation for a problem is as difficult as choosing a good search algorithm for a problem. Wolpert and Macready's (1995) No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem proves that no search algorithm is better than any other over all possible discrete functions. Radcliffe and Surry (1995) extend these notions to also cover the idea that all representations are equivalent when their behavior is considered on average over all possible functions. To understand these results, we first outline some of the simple assumptions behind this theorem. First, assume the optimization problem is discrete; this describes all combinatorial optimization problems-and really all optimization problems being solved on computers since computers have finite precision. Second, we ignore the fact that we can resample points in the space. The ""No Free Lunch"" result can be stated as follows: ","Title: Nonlinearity, Hyperplane Ranking and the Simple Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: Several metrics are used in empirical studies to explore the mechanisms of convergence of genetic algorithms. The metric is designed to measure the consistency of an arbitrary ranking of hyperplanes in a partition with respect to a target string. Walsh coefficients can be calculated for small functions in order to characterize sources of linear and nonlinear interactions. A simple deception measure is also developed to look closely at the effects of increasing nonlinearity of functions. Correlations between the metric and deception measure are discussed and relationships between and convergence behavior of a simple genetic algorithm are studied over large sets of functions with varying degrees of nonlinearity.",1
"Title: Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on
Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised induction of a distance from examples described as Horn clauses or constrained clauses. In opposition to syntax-driven approaches, this approach is discrimination-driven: it proceeds by defining a small set of complex discriminant hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as new concepts, used to redescribe the initial examples. Further, this redescription can be embedded into the space of natural integers, and a distance between examples thus naturally follows. ","Title: Rule Induction and Instance-Based Learning: A Unified Approach  
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to inductive learning that combines aspects of instance-based learning and rule induction in a single simple algorithm. The RISE system searches for rules in a specific-to-general fashion, starting with one rule per training example, and avoids some of the difficulties of separate-and-conquer approaches by evaluating each proposed induction step globally, i.e., through an efficient procedure that is equivalent to checking the accuracy of the rule set as a whole on every training example. Classification is performed using a best-match strategy, and reduces to nearest-neighbor if all generalizations of instances were rejected. An extensive empirical study shows that RISE consistently achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art representatives of its ""parent"" paradigms (PEBLS and CN2), and also outperforms a decision-tree learner (C4.5) in 13 out of 15 test domains (in ",1
"Title: University of Nevada Reno Design Strategies for Evolutionary Robotics  
Abstract: CuPit-2 is a special-purpose programming language designed for expressing dynamic neural network learning algorithms. It provides most of the flexibility of general-purpose languages such as C or C ++ , but is more expressive. It allows writing much clearer and more elegant programs, in particular for algorithms that change the network topology dynamically (constructive algorithms, pruning algorithms). In contrast to other languages, CuPit-2 programs can be compiled into efficient code for parallel machines without any changes in the source program, thus providing an easy start for using parallel platforms. This article analyzes the circumstances under which the CuPit-2 approach is the most useful one, presents a description of most language constructs and reports performance results for CuPit-2 on symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). It concludes that in many cases CuPit-2 is a good basis for neural learning algorithm research on small-scale parallel machines. ","Title: Adapting Control Strategies for Situated Autonomous Agents

"Title: Hierarchical Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning (EBRL) was introduced by Dietterich and Flann as a way of combining the ability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn optimal plans with the generalization ability of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) (Di-etterich & Flann, 1995). We extend this work to domains where the agent must order and achieve a sequence of subgoals in an optimal fashion. Hierarchical EBRL can effectively learn optimal policies in some of these sequential task domains even when the subgoals weakly interact with each other. We also show that when a planner that can achieve the individual subgoals is available, our method converges even faster. ","Title: Machine Learning,  Explanation-Based Learning and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified View  
Abstract: In speedup-learning problems, where full descriptions of operators are known, both explanation-based learning (EBL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be applied. This paper shows that both methods involve fundamentally the same process of propagating information backward from the goal toward the starting state. Most RL methods perform this propagation on a state-by-state basis, while EBL methods compute the weakest preconditions of operators, and hence, perform this propagation on a region-by-region basis. Barto, Bradtke, and Singh (1995) have observed that many algorithms for reinforcement learning can be viewed as asynchronous dynamic programming. Based on this observation, this paper shows how to develop dynamic programming versions of EBL, which we call region-based dynamic programming or Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning (EBRL). The paper compares batch and online versions of EBRL to batch and online versions of point-based dynamic programming and to standard EBL. The results show that region-based dynamic programming combines the strengths of EBL (fast learning and the ability to scale to large state spaces) with the strengths of reinforcement learning algorithms (learning of optimal policies). Results are shown in chess endgames and in synthetic maze tasks. ",1
"Title: On Convergence of the EM Algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler  SUMMARY  
Abstract: In this article we investigate the relationship between the two popular algorithms, the EM algorithm and the Gibbs sampler. We show that the approximate rate of convergence of the Gibbs sampler by Gaussian approximation is equal to that of the corresponding EM type algorithm. This helps in implementing either of the algorithms as improvement strategies for one algorithm can be directly transported to the other. In particular, by running the EM algorithm we know approximately how many iterations are needed for convergence of the Gibbs sampler. We also obtain a result that under conditions, the EM algorithm used for finding the maximum likelihood estimates can be slower to converge than the corresponding Gibbs sampler for Bayesian inference which uses proper prior distributions. We illustrate our results in a number of realistic examples all based on the generalized linear mixed models.

Abstract: We describe the maximum-likelihood parameter estimation problem and how the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used for its solution. We first describe the abstract form of the EM algorithm as it is often given in the literature. We then develop the EM parameter estimation procedure for two applications: 1) finding the parameters of a mixture of Gaussian densities, and 2) finding the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM) (i.e., the Baum-Welch algorithm) for both discrete and Gaussian mixture observation models. We derive the update equations in fairly explicit detail but we do not prove any convergence properties. We try to emphasize intuition rather than mathematical rigor. ",1

The genetic algorithm (GA) is a central component of the model. The paper reports simulation experiments on two pattern recognition problems that are relevant to natural immune systems. Finally, it reviews the relation between the model and explicit fitness sharing techniques for genetic algorithms, showing that the immune system model implements a form of implicit fitness sharing.

Abstract: A cooperative coevolutionary approach to learning complex structures is presented which, although preliminary in nature, appears to have a number of advantages over non-coevolutionary approaches. The cooperative coevolutionary approach encourages the parallel evolution of substructures which interact in useful ways to form more complex higher level structures. The architecture is designed to be general enough to permit the inclusion, if appropriate, of a priori knowledge in the form of initial biases towards particular kinds of decompositions. A brief summary of initial results obtained from testing this architecture in several problem domains is presented which shows a significant speedup over more traditional non-coevolutionary approaches.

Abstract: NK-landscapes offer the ability to assess the performance of evolutionary algorithms on problems with different degrees of epistasis. In this paper, we study the performance of six algorithms in NK-landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant. The results show that compared to genetic local search algorithms, the performance of standard genetic algorithms employing crossover or mutation significantly decreases with increasing problem size. Furthermore, with increasing K, crossover based algorithms are in both cases outperformed by mutation based algorithms. However, the relative performance differences between the algorithms grow significantly with the dimension of the search space, indicating that it is important to consider high-dimensional landscapes for evaluating the performance of evolutionary algorithms.

"Title: The Effective Size of a Neural Network: A Principal Component Approach  
Abstract: Often when learning from data, one attaches a penalty term to a standard error term in an attempt to prefer simple models and prevent overfitting. Current penalty terms for neural networks, however, often do not take into account weight interaction. This is a critical drawback since the effective number of parameters in a network usually differs dramatically from the total number of possible parameters. In this paper, we present a penalty term that uses Principal Component Analysis to help detect functional redundancy in a neural network. Results show that our new algorithm gives a much more accurate estimate of network complexity than do standard approaches. As a result, our new term should be able to improve techniques that make use of a penalty term, such as weight decay, weight pruning, feature selection, Bayesian, and prediction-risk tech niques.","Title: Using Sampling and Queries to Extract Rules from Trained Neural Networks  
Abstract: Concepts learned by neural networks are difficult to understand because they are represented using large assemblages of real-valued parameters. One approach to understanding trained neural networks is to extract symbolic rules that describe their classification behavior. There are several existing rule-extraction approaches that operate by searching for such rules. We present a novel method that casts rule extraction not as a search problem, but instead as a learning problem. In addition to learning from training examples, our method exploits the property that networks can be efficiently queried. We describe algorithms for extracting both conjunctive and M -of-N rules, and present experiments that show that our method is more efficient than conventional search-based approaches.",1

Abstract: Technical Report #1072, D epartement d'Informatique et Recherche Op erationnelle, Universit e de Montr eal Abstract Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], in particular decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks applied to character recognition tasks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 2% error on the UCI Letters offline characters data set.","Title: Constraint Tangent Distance for On-line Character Recognition

The system has been implemented with a k-nearest neighbor classifier and a so called diabolo classifier [6] respectively. Both classifiers are invariant under transformations like rotation, scale or slope and can deal with variations in stroke order and writing direction. Results are presented for our digit database with more than 200 writers. ",1
"Title: Task-Oriented Knowledge Acquisition and Reasoning for Design Support Systems  
Abstract: We present a framework for task-driven knowledge acquisition in the development of design support systems. Different types of knowledge that enter the knowledge base of a design support system are defined and illustrated both from a formal and from a knowledge acquisition vantage point. Special emphasis is placed on the task-structure, which is used to guide both acquisition and application of knowledge. Starting with knowledge for planning steps in design and augmenting this with problem-solving knowledge that supports design, a formal integrated model of knowledge for design is constructed. Based on the notion of knowledge acquisition as an incremental process we give an account of possibilities for problem solving depending on the knowledge that is at the disposal of the system. Finally, we depict how different kinds of knowledge interact in a design support system. ?

Abstract: This paper presents the formalization of a novel approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation in case-based reasoning (Cbr) for synthesis. The approach has been informally presented, exemplified, and implemented for the domain of industrial building design (Borner 1993). By relating the approach to existing theories we provide the foundation of its systematic evaluation and appropriate usage. Cases, the primary repository of knowledge, are represented structurally using an algebraic approach. Similarity relations provide structure preserving case modifications modulo the underlying algebra and an equational theory over the algebra (so available). This representation of a modeled universe of discourse enables theory-based inference of adapted solutions. The approach enables us to incorporate formally generalization, abstraction, geometrical transformation, and their combinations into Cbr. ",1

","Title: Exploratory Modelling of Multiple Non-Stationary Time Series: Latent Process Structure and Decompositions  
Abstract: We describe and illustrate Bayesian approaches to modelling and analysis of multiple non-stationary time series. This begins with uni-variate models for collections of related time series assumedly driven by underlying but unobservable processes, referred to as dynamic latent factor processes. We focus on models in which the factor processes, and hence the observed time series, are modelled by time-varying autoregressions capable of flexibly representing ranges of observed non-stationary characteristics. We highlight concepts and new methods of time series decomposition to infer characteristics of latent components in time series, and relate uni-variate decomposition analyses to underlying multivariate dynamic factor structure. Our motivating application is in analysis of multiple EEG traces from an ongoing EEG study at Duke. In this study, individuals undergoing ECT therapy generate multiple EEG traces at various scalp locations, and physiological interest lies in identifying dependencies and dissimilarities across series. In addition to the multivariate and non-stationary aspects of the series, this area provides illustration of the new results about decomposition of time series into latent, physically interpretable components; this is illustrated in data analysis of one EEG data set.

Since in our case no `examples' are available, the system learns on the basis of an external reinforcement signal which is negative in case of a collision and zero otherwise.

Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.",1

Abstract: Novel on-line learning algorithms with self adaptive learning rates (parameters) for blind separation of signals are proposed. The main motivation for development of new learning rules is to improve convergence speed and to reduce cross-talking, especially for non-stationary signals. Furthermore, we have discovered that under some conditions the proposed neural network models with associated learning algorithms exhibit a random switch of attention, i.e. they have ability of chaotic or random switching or cross-over of output signals in such way that a specified separated signal may appear at various outputs at different time windows. Validity, performance and dynamic properties of the proposed learning algorithms are investigated by computer simulation experiments. ","Title: Equivariant adaptive source separation  
Abstract: Source separation consists in recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation which implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called EASI (Equivariant Adaptive Separation via Independence). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating: this specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple, parallelizable structure, for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Close form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. This is completed by some numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

"Title: Efficient Inference in Bayes Networks As A Combinatorial Optimization Problem  
Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. The techniques used in these algorithms are closely related to network structures and some of them are not easy to understand and implement. In this paper, we consider the problem from the combinatorial optimization point of view and state that efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network is a problem of finding an optimal factoring given a set of probability distributions. From this viewpoint, previously developed algorithms can be seen as alternate factoring strategies. In this paper, we define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and demonstrate simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance.

Abstract: We show an alternative way of representing a Bayesian belief network by sensitivities and probability distributions. This representation is equivalent to the traditional representation by conditional probabilities, but makes dependencies between nodes apparent and intuitively easy to understand. We also propose a QR matrix representation for the sensitivities and/or conditional probabilities which is more efficient, in both memory requirements and computational speed, than the traditional representation for computer-based implementations of probabilistic inference. We use sensitivities to show that for a certain class of binary networks, the computation time for approximate probabilistic inference with any positive upper bound on the error of the result is independent of the size of the network. Finally, as an alternative to traditional algorithms that use conditional probabilities, we describe an exact algorithm for probabilistic inference that uses the QR-representation for sensitivities and updates probability distributions of nodes in a network according to messages from the neigh bors.",1
"Title: On-Line Adaptation of a Signal Predistorter through Dual Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: Most connectionist modeling assumes noise-free inputs. This assumption is often violated. This paper introduces the idea of clearning, of simultaneously cleaning the data and learning the underlying structure. The cleaning step can be viewed as top-down processing (where the model modifies the data), and the learning step can be viewed as bottom-up processing (where the data modifies the model). Clearning is used in conjunction with standard pruning. This paper discusses the statistical foundation of clearning, gives an interpretation in terms of a mechanical model, describes how to obtain both point predictions and conditional densities for the output, and shows how the resulting model can be used to discover properties of the data otherwise not accessible (such as the signal-to-noise ratio of the inputs). This paper uses clearning to predict foreign exchange rates, a noisy time series problem with well-known benchmark performances. On the out-of-sample 1993-1994 test period, clearning obtains an annualized return on investment above 30%, significantly better than an otherwise identical network. The final ultra-sparse network with 36 remaining non-zero input-to-hidden weights (of the 1035 initial weights between 69 inputs and 15 hidden units) is very robust against overfitting. This small network also lends itself to interpretation.","Title: Evaluating Neural Network Predictors by Bootstrapping  
Abstract: We present a new method, inspired by the bootstrap, whose goal it is to determine the quality and reliability of a neural network predictor. Our method leads to more robust forecasting along with a large amount of statistical information on forecast performance that we exploit. We exhibit the method in the context of multi-variate time series prediction on financial data from the New York Stock Exchange. It turns out that the variation due to different resamplings (i.e., splits between training, cross-validation, and test sets) is significantly larger than the variation due to different network conditions (such as architecture and initial weights). Furthermore, this method allows us to forecast a probability distribution, as opposed to the traditional case of just a single value at each time step. We demonstrate this on a strictly held-out test set that includes the 1987 stock market crash. We also compare the performance of the class of neural networks to identically bootstrapped linear models.",1
"Title: Prototype and Feature Selection by Sampling and Random Mutation Hill Climbing Algorithms  
Abstract: With the goal of reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy, we describe two algorithms to find sets of prototypes for nearest neighbor classification. Here, the term prototypes refers to the reference instances used in a nearest neighbor computation the instances with respect to which similarity is assessed in order to assign a class to a new data item. Both algorithms rely on stochastic techniques to search the space of sets of prototypes and are simple to implement. The first is a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm; the second applies random mutation hill climbing. On four datasets we show that only three or four prototypes sufficed to give predictive accuracy equal or superior to a basic nearest neighbor algorithm whose run-time storage costs were approximately 10 to 200 times greater. We briefly investigate how random mutation hill climbing may be applied to select features and prototypes simultaneously. Finally, we explain the performance of the sampling algorithm on these datasets in terms of a statistical measure of the extent of clustering displayed by the target classes.","Title: Growing Simpler Decision Trees to Facilitate Knowledge Discovery  
Abstract: When using machine learning techniques for knowledge discovery, output that is comprehensible to a human is as important as predictive accuracy.

It does this by using genetic search to select the set of input features C4.5 is allowed to use to build its tree. We test SET-Gen on a wide variety of real-world datasets and show that SET-Gen trees are significantly smaller and reference significantly fewer features than trees grown by C4.5 without using SET-Gen. Statistical significance tests show that the accuracies of SET-Gen's trees are either not distinguishable from or are more accurate than those of the original C4.5 trees on all ten datasets tested.

"Title: Multiple Network Systems (Minos) Modules: Task Division and Module Discrimination 1  
Abstract: It is widely considered an ultimate connectionist objective to incorporate neural networks into intelligent systems. These systems are intended to possess a varied repertoire of functions enabling adaptable interaction with a non-static environment. The first step in this direction is to develop various neural network algorithms and models, the second step is to combine such networks into a modular structure that might be incorporated into a workable system. In this paper we consider one aspect of the second point, namely: processing reliability and hiding of wetware details. Pre- sented is an architecture for a type of neural expert module, named an Authority. An Authority consists of a number of Minos modules. Each of the Minos modules in an Authority has the same processing capabilities, but varies with respect to its particular specialization to aspects of the problem domain. The Authority employs the collection of Minoses like a panel of experts. The expert with the highest confidence is believed, and it is the answer and confidence quotient that are transmitted to other levels in a system hierarchy. ","Title: Data Exploration with Reflective Adaptive Models  
Abstract: Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner dersnlp+ebl. der-snlp+ebl extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.",1

Abstract: We study the learnability of Read-k-Satisfy-j (RkSj) DNF formulas. These are boolean formulas in disjunctive normal form (DNF), in which the maximum number of occurrences of a variable is bounded by k, and the number of terms satisfied by any assignment is at most j. After motivating the investigation of this class of DNF formulas, we present an algorithm that with high probability finds a DNF formula that is logically equivalent to any unknown RkSj DNF formula to be learned. The algorithm uses the well-studied protocol of equivalence and membership queries, and runs in polynomial time for k j = O( log n log log n ), where n is the number of input variables.","Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees. Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity. ",1

Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis and synthesis of acoustical instruments based on data-driven probabilistic inference modeling. Audio time series and boundary conditions of a played instrument are recorded and the non-linear mapping from the control data into the audio space is inferred using the general inference framework of Cluster-Weighted Modeling. The resulting model is used for real-time synthesis of audio sequences from new input data.",1
"Title: Update rules for parameter estimation in Bayesian networks  
Abstract: This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian networks with missing values and hidden variables from the perspective of recent work in on-line learning [12]. We provide a unified framework for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, our framework encompasses both the gradient projection algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame ters than does standard EM.","Title: How to Use Expert Advice (Extended Abstract)  
Abstract: We analyze algorithms that predict a binary value by combining the predictions of several prediction strategies, called experts. Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We give implications of this result on the performance of batch learning algorithms in a PAC setting which improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes. ",1
"Title: Case Retrieval Nets: Basic Ideas and Extensions  
Abstract: An efficient retrieval of a relatively small number of relevant cases from a huge case base is a crucial subtask of Case-Based Reasoning. In this article, we present Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs), a memory model that has recently been developed for this task. The main idea is to apply a spreading activation process to a net-like case memory in order to retrieve cases being similar to a posed query case. We summarize the basic ideas of CRNs, suggest some useful extensions, and present some initial experimental results which suggest that CRNs can successfully handle case bases larger than considered usually in the CBR community.

The internal case memory is implemented as a Case Retrieval Net. This allows to handle large case bases with an efficient retrieval process.

"Title: Prototype and Feature Selection by Sampling and Random Mutation Hill Climbing Algorithms  
Abstract: With the goal of reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy, we describe two algorithms to find sets of prototypes for nearest neighbor classification. Here, the term prototypes refers to the reference instances used in a nearest neighbor computation the instances with respect to which similarity is assessed in order to assign a class to a new data item. Both algorithms rely on stochastic techniques to search the space of sets of prototypes and are simple to implement. The first is a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm; the second applies random mutation hill climbing. On four datasets we show that only three or four prototypes sufficed to give predictive accuracy equal or superior to a basic nearest neighbor algorithm whose run-time storage costs were approximately 10 to 200 times greater. We briefly investigate how random mutation hill climbing may be applied to select features and prototypes simultaneously. Finally, we explain the performance of the sampling algorithm on these datasets in terms of a statistical measure of the extent of clustering displayed by the target classes.","Title: CBET: a Case Base Exploration Tool  
Abstract: We consider the question ""How should one act when the only goal is to learn as much as possible?"" Building on the theoretical results of Fedorov [1972] and MacKay [1992], we apply techniques from Optimal Experiment Design (OED) to guide the query/action selection of a neural network learner. We demonstrate that these techniques allow the learner to minimize its generalization error by exploring its domain efficiently and completely. We conclude that, while not a panacea, OED-based query/action has much to offer, especially in domains where its high computational costs can be tolerated.

"Title: MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING IN REACTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC NAVIGATION  
Abstract: This paper presents a self-improving reactive control system for autonomous robotic navigation. The navigation module uses a schema-based reactive control system to perform the navigation task. The learning module combines case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to continuously tune the navigation system through experience. The case-based reasoning component perceives and characterizes the system's environment, retrieves an appropriate case, and uses the recommendations of the case to tune the parameters of the reactive control system. The reinforcement learning component refines the content of the cases based on the current experience. Together, the learning components perform on-line adaptation, resulting in improved performance as the reactive control system tunes itself to the environment, as well as on-line case learning, resulting in an improved library of cases that capture environmental regularities necessary to perform on-line adaptation. The system is extensively evaluated through simulation studies using several performance metrics and system configurations.","Title: Knowledge Compilation and Speedup Learning in Continuous Task Domains  
Abstract: Many techniques for speedup learning and knowledge compilation focus on the learning and optimization of macro-operators or control rules in task domains that can be characterized using a problem-space search paradigm. However, such a characterization does not fit well the class of task domains in which the problem solver is required to perform in a continuous manner. For example, in many robotic domains, the problem solver is required to monitor real-valued perceptual inputs and vary its motor control parameters in a continuous, on-line manner to successfully accomplish its task. In such domains, discrete symbolic states and operators are difficult to define. To improve its performance in continuous problem domains, a problem solver must learn, modify, and use continuous operators that continuously map input sensory information to appropriate control outputs. Additionally, the problem solver must learn the contexts in which those continuous operators are applicable. We propose a learning method that can compile sensorimo-tor experiences into continuous operators, which can then be used to improve performance of the problem solver. The method speeds up the task performance as well as results in improvements in the quality of the resulting solutions. The method is implemented in a robotic navigation system, which is evaluated through extensive experimen tation.",1
"Title: Constructing Nominal Xof-N Attributes  
Abstract: Most constructive induction researchers focus only on new boolean attributes. This paper reports a new constructive induction algorithm, called XofN, that constructs new nominal attributes in the form of Xof-N representations. An Xof-N is a set containing one or more attribute-value pairs. For a given instance, its value corresponds to the number of its attribute-value pairs that are true. The promising preliminary experimental results, on both artificial and real-world domains, show that constructing new nominal attributes in the form of Xof-N representations can significantly improve the performance of selective induction in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity.","Title: Continuous-valued Xof-N Attributes Versus Nominal Xof-N Attributes for Constructive Induction: A Case Study  
Abstract: An Xof-N is a set containing one or more attribute-value pairs. For a given instance, its value corresponds to the number of its attribute-value pairs that are true. In this paper, we explore the characteristics and performance of continuous-valued Xof-N attributes versus nominal Xof-N attributes for constructive induction. Nominal Xof-Ns are more representationally powerful than continuous-valued Xof-Ns, but the former suffer the ""fragmentation"" problem, although some mechanisms such as subsetting can help to solve the problem. Two approaches to constructive induction using continuous-valued Xof-Ns are described. Continuous-valued Xof-Ns perform better than nominal ones on domains that need Xof-Ns with only one cut point. On domains that need Xof-N representations with more than one cut point, nominal Xof-Ns perform better than continuous-valued ones. Experimental results on a set of artificial and real-world domains support these statements. ",1
"Title: Using Introspective Reasoning to Select Learning Strategies  
Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a system must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires a declaratflive representation of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task. This paper presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during this task, their declarative representations, and their associations with particular learning strategies. We propose a theory of Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. A program called Meta-AQUA embodies the theory and processes examples in the domain of drug smuggling. ","Title: Decision Models: A Theory of Volitional Explanation  
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of motivational analysis, the construction of volitional explanations to describe the planning behavior of agents. We discuss both the content of such explanations, as well as the process by which an understander builds the explanations. Explanations are constructed from decision models, which describe the planning process that an agent goes through when considering whether to perform an action. Decision models are represented as explanation patterns, which are standard patterns of causality based on previous experiences of the understander. We discuss the nature of explanation patterns, their use in representing decision models, and the process by which they are retrieved, used and evaluated.",1
"Title: The Limits of Instruction Level Parallelism in SPEC95 Applications  
Abstract: This paper examines the limits to instruction level parallelism that can be found in programs, in particular the SPEC95 benchmark suite. It differs from earlier studies in removing non-essential true dependencies that occur as a result of the compiler employing a stack for subroutine linkage. This is a subtle limitation to parallelism that is not readily evident as it appears as a true dependency on the stack pointer. In this paper we show that its removal exposes far more parallelism than has been seen previously. We refer to this type of parallelism as ""parallelism at a distance"" because it requires impossibly large instruction windows for detection. We conclude with two observations: 1) that a single instruction window characteristic of superscalar machines is inadequate for detecting parallelism at a distance; and 2) in order to take advantage of this parallelism the compiler must be involved, or separate threads must be explicitly programmed. ","Title: THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM  
Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split Window (ESW) paradigm, for exploiting fine-grain parallelism. This paradigm considers a window of instructions (possibly having dependencies) as a single unit, and exploits fine-grain parallelism by overlapping the execution of multiple windows. The basic idea is to connect multiple sequential processors, in a decoupled and decentralized manner, to achieve overall multiple issue. This processing paradigm shares a number of properties of the restricted dataflow machines, but was derived from the sequential von Neumann architecture. We also present an implementation of the Expandable Split Window execution model, and preliminary performance results. ",1
"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

Abstract: The optimization of a single bit string by means of iterated mutation and selection of the best (a (1+1)-Genetic Algorithm) is discussed with respect to three simple fitness functions: The counting ones problem, a standard binary encoded integer, and a Gray coded integer optimization problem. A mutation rate schedule that is optimal with respect to the success probability of mutation is presented for each of the objective functions, and it turns out that the standard binary code can hamper the search process even in case of unimodal objective functions. While normally a mutation rate of 1=l (where l denotes the bit string length) is recommendable, our results indicate that a variation of the mutation rate is useful in cases where the fitness function is a multimodal pseudo-boolean function, where multimodality may be caused by the objective function as well as the encoding mechanism.",1
"Title: Structured Representation of Complex Stochastic Systems  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of representing complex systems that evolve stochastically over time. Dynamic Bayesian networks provide a compact representation for stochastic processes. Unfortunately, they are often unwieldy since they cannot explicitly model the complex organizational structure of many real life systems: the fact that processes are typically composed of several interacting subprocesses, each of which can, in turn, be further decomposed. We propose a hierarchically structured representation language which extends both dynamic Bayesian networks and the object-oriented Bayesian network framework of [9], and show that our language allows us to describe such systems in a natural and modular way. Our language supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. For example, it allows us to represent systems where some processes evolve at a different rate than others, or systems where the processes interact only intermittently. We provide a simple inference mechanism for our representation via translation to Bayesian networks, and suggest ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in our representation. ","Title: Context-Specific Independence in Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: Bayesiannetworks provide a languagefor qualitatively representing the conditional independence properties of a distribution. This allows a natural and compact representation of the distribution, eases knowledge acquisition, and supports effective inference algorithms. It is well-known, however, that there are certain independencies that we cannot capture qualitatively within the Bayesian network structure: independencies that hold only in certain contexts, i.e., given a specific assignment of values to certain variables. In this paper, we propose a formal notion of context-specific independence (CSI), based on regularities in the conditional probability tables (CPTs) at a node. We present a technique, analogous to (and based on) d-separation, for determining when such independence holds in a given network. We then focus on a particular qualitative representation schemetree-structured CPTs for capturing CSI. We suggest ways in which this representation can be used to support effective inference algorithms. In particular, we present a structural decomposition of the resulting network which can improve the performance of clustering algorithms, and an alternative algorithm based on cutset conditioning.",1

Abstract: Dynamic programming provides a methodology to develop planners and controllers for nonlinear systems. However, general dynamic programming is computationally intractable. We have developed procedures that allow more complex planning and control problems to be solved.

We maintain global consistency of the local models of the value function, guaranteeing that our locally optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up to the resolution of our search procedures.","Title: Control Systems Magazine, 14, 1, pp.57-71.

"Title: Machine Learning and Inference  
Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches: onefor the best representation space, and twofor the best hypothesis in that space. In data-driven constructive induction (DCI), a learning system searches for a better representation space by analyzing the input examples (data). The presented data-driven constructive induction method combines an AQ-type learning algorithm with two classes of representation space improvement operators: constructors, and destructors. The implemented system, AQ17-DCI, has been experimentally applied to a GNP prediction problem using a World Bank database. The results show that decision rules learned by AQ17-DCI outperformed the rules learned in the original representation space both in predictive accuracy and rule simplicity.","Title: CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION FROM DATA IN AQ17-DCI: Further Experiments  
Abstract: Abstract | In this document, I first review the theory behind bits-back coding (aka. free energy coding) (Frey and Hinton 1996) and then describe the interface to C-language software that can be used for bits-back coding. This method is a new approach to the problem of optimal compression when a source code produces multiple codewords for a given symbol. It may seem that the most sensible codeword to use in this case is the shortest one. However, in the proposed bits-back approach, random codeword selection yields an effective codeword length that can be less than the shortest codeword length. If the random choices are Boltzmann distributed, the effective length is optimal for the given source code. The software which I describe in this guide is easy to use and the source code is only a few pages long. I illustrate the bits-back coding software on a simple quantized Gaussian mixture problem. ",1

Abstract: We describe a polynomial-time algorithm for learning axis-aligned rectangles in Q d with respect to product distributions from multiple-instance examples in the PAC model. Here, each example consists of n elements of Q d together with a label indicating whether any of the n points is in the rectangle to be learned. We assume that there is an unknown product distribution D over Q d such that all instances are independently drawn according to D. The accuracy of a hypothesis is measured by the probability that it would incorrectly predict whether one of n more points drawn from D was in the rectangle to be learned.

Abstract: Multiple-instance learning is a variation on supervised learning, where the task is to learn a concept given positive and negative bags of instances. Each bag may contain many instances, but a bag is labeled positive even if only one of the instances in it falls within the concept. A bag is labeled negative only if all the instances in it are negative. We describe a new general framework, called Diverse Density, for solving multiple-instance learning problems. We apply this framework to learn a simple description of a person from a series of images (bags) containing that person, to a stock selection problem, and to the drug activity prediction problem.",1

Abstract: Traits that are acquired by members of an evolving population during their lifetime, through adaptive processes such as learning, can become genetically specified in later generations. Thus there is a change in the level of learning in the population over evolutionary time. This paper explores the idea that as well as the benefits to be gained from learning, there may also be costs to be paid for the ability to learn. It is these costs that supply the selection pressure for the genetic assimilation of acquired traits. Two models are presented that attempt to illustrate this assertion. The first uses Kauffman's NK fitness landscapes to show the effect that both explicit and implicit costs have on the assimilation of learnt traits. A characteristic `hump' is observed in the graph of the level of plasticity in the population showing that learning is first selected for and then against as evolution progresses. The second model is a practical example in which neural network controllers are evolved for a small mobile robot. Results from this experiment also show the hump. ",1
"Title: Finite State Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks Automata and Dynamical Systems Approaches  
Abstract: Decision Trees have been widely used for classification/regression tasks. They are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks and are understandable by humans. In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree.","Title: Analysis of Dynamical Recognizers  
Abstract: Pollack (1991) demonstrated that second-order recurrent neural networks can act as dynamical recognizers for formal languages when trained on positive and negative examples, and observed both phase transitions in learning and IFS-like fractal state sets. Follow-on work focused mainly on the extraction and minimization of a finite state automaton (FSA) from the trained network. However, such networks are capable of inducing languages which are not regular, and therefore not equivalent to any FSA. Indeed, it may be simpler for a small network to fit its training data by inducing such a non-regular language. But when is the network's language not regular? In this paper, using a low dimensional network capable of learning all the Tomita data sets, we present an empirical method for testing whether the language induced by the network is regular or not. We also provide a detailed ""-machine analysis of trained networks for both regular and non-regular languages. ",1

Abstract: In this paper we study the performance of gradient descent when applied to the problem of on-line linear prediction in arbitrary inner product spaces. We prove worst-case bounds on the sum of the squared prediction errors under various assumptions concerning the amount of a priori information about the sequence to predict. The algorithms we use are variants and extensions of on-line gradient descent. Whereas our algorithms always predict using linear functions as hypotheses, none of our results requires the data to be linearly related. In fact, the bounds proved on the total prediction loss are typically expressed as a function of the total loss of the best fixed linear predictor with bounded norm. All the upper bounds are tight to within constants. Matching lower bounds are provided in some cases. Finally, we apply our results to the problem of on-line prediction for classes of smooth functions. ",1
"Title: A Survey of Evolution Strategies  
Abstract:  ","Title: A Sampling-Based Heuristic for Tree Search Applied to Grammar Induction  
Abstract: In the field of Operation Research and Artificial Intelligence, several stochastic search algorithms have been designed based on the theory of global random search (Zhigljavsky 1991). Basically, those techniques iteratively sample the search space with respect to a probability distribution which is updated according to the result of previous samples and some predefined strategy. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) (Goldberg 1989) or Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) (Feo & Resende 1995) are two particular instances of this paradigm. In this paper, we present SAGE, a search algorithm based on the same fundamental mechanisms as those techniques. However, it addresses a class of problems for which it is difficult to design transformation operators to perform local search because of intrinsic constraints in the definition of the problem itself. For those problems, a procedural approach is the natural way to construct solutions, resulting in a state space represented as a tree or a DAG. The aim of this paper is to describe the underlying heuristics used by SAGE to address problems belonging to that class. The performance of SAGE is analyzed on the problem of grammar induction and its successful application to problems from the recent Abbadingo DFA learning competition is presented. ",1

Abstract: There are many applications in which it is desirable to order rather than classify instances. Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a preference function, of the form PREF(u; v), which indicates whether it is advisable to rank u before v. New instances are then ordered so as to maximize agreements with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a preference function is NP-complete, even under very restrictive assumptions. Nevertheless, we describe a simple greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a good approximation. We then discuss an on-line learning algorithm, based on the ""Hedge"" algorithm, for finding a good linear combination of ranking ""experts."" We use the ordering algorithm combined with the on-line learning algorithm to find a combination of ""search experts,"" each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a WWW search engine, and present experimental results that demonstrate the merits of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents an ASOCS (adaptive self-organizing concurrent system) model for massively parallel processing of incrementally defined rule systems in such areas as adaptive logic, robotics, logical inference, and dynamic control. An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel.

An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During the data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. In learning mode, rules expressed as boolean conjunctions are incrementally presented to the ASOCS. All ASOCS learning algorithms incorporate a new rule in a distributed fashion in a short, bounded time. ",1
"Title: Figure 1: The architecture of a Kohonen network. Each input neuron is fully connected with
Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

"Title: Using Genetic Programming to Evolve Board Evaluation Functions  
Abstract: The purpose of most architecture optimization schemes is to improve generalization. In this presentation we suggest to estimate the weight saliency as the associated change in generalization error if the weight is pruned. We detail the implementation of both an O(N )-storage scheme extending OBD, as well as an O(N 2 ) scheme extending OBS. We illustrate the viability of the approach on pre diction of a chaotic time series.","Title: New Methods for Competitive Coevolution  
Abstract: We consider ""competitive coevolution,"" in which fitness is based on direct competition among individuals selected from two independently evolving populations of ""hosts"" and ""parasites."" Competitive coevolution can lead to an ""arms race,"" in which the two populations reciprocally drive one another to increasing levels of performance and complexity. We use the games of Nim and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe as test problems to explore three new techniques in competitive coevolution. ""Competitive fitness sharing"" changes the way fitness is measured, ""shared sampling"" provides a method for selecting a strong, diverse set of parasites, and the ""hall of fame"" encourages arms races by saving good individuals from prior generations. We provide several different motivations for these methods, and mathematical insights into their use. Experimental comparisons are done, and a detailed analysis of these experiments is presented in terms of testing issues, diversity, extinction, arms race progress measurements, and drift. ",1
"Title: On the Greediness of Feature Selection Algorithms  
Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greediness of forward feature selection algorithms does not severely corrupt the accuracy of function approximation using the selected input features, but improves the efficiency significantly. Hence, we propose three greedier algorithms in order to further enhance the efficiency of the feature selection processing. We provide empirical results for linear regression, locally weighted regression and k-nearest-neighbor models. We also propose to use these algorithms to develop an offline Chinese and Japanese handwriting recognition system with auto matically configured, local models. ","Title: Toward Optimal Feature Selection  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a method for feature subset selection based on Information Theory. Initially, a framework for defining the theoretically optimal, but computation-ally intractable, method for feature subset selection is presented. We show that our goal should be to eliminate a feature if it gives us little or no additional information beyond that subsumed by the remaining features. In particular, this will be the case for both irrelevant and redundant features. We then give an efficient algorithm for feature selection which computes an approximation to the optimal feature selection criterion. The conditions under which the approximate algorithm is successful are examined. Empirical results are given on a number of data sets, showing that the algorithm effectively han dles datasets with large numbers of features.",1
"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Bayesian Non-linear Modelling for the Prediction Competition  
Abstract: The 1993 energy prediction competition involved the prediction of a series of building energy loads from a series of environmental input variables. Non-linear regression using `neural networks' is a popular technique for such modeling tasks. Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many possible input variables, some of which may actually be irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a finite data set will show random correlations between the irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural network (even with reg-ularisation or `weight decay') will not set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance. The Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) model puts a prior over the regression parameters which embodies the concept of relevance. This is done in a simple and `soft' way by introducing multiple regularisation constants, one associated with each input. Using Bayesian methods, the regularisation constants for junk inputs are automatically inferred to be large, preventing those inputs from causing significant overfitting. ",1
"Title: Associative Reinforcement Learning: Functions in k-DNF  
Abstract: An agent that must learn to act in the world by trial and error faces the reinforcement learning problem, which is quite different from standard concept learning. Although good algorithms exist for this problem in the general case, they are often quite inefficient and do not exhibit generalization. One strategy is to find restricted classes of action policies that can be learned more efficiently. This paper pursues that strategy by developing algorithms that can efficiently learn action maps that are expressible in k-DNF. The algorithms are compared with existing methods in empirical trials and are shown to have very good performance.

"Title: Formal Rules for Selecting Prior Distributions: A Review and Annotated Bibliography  
Abstract: Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet, in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called ""noninfor-mative"" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors, and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his point of view about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly; when sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated) it is dangerous to put faith in any ""default"" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices.

"Title: STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF COMBAT WITH HUMAN FACTORS  
Abstract: This highly interdisciplinary project extends previous work in combat modeling and in control-theoretic descriptions of decision-making human factors in complex activities. A previous paper has established the first theory of the statistical mechanics of combat (SMC), developed using modern methods of statistical mechanics, baselined to empirical data gleaned from the National Training Center (NTC). This previous project has also established a JANUS(T)-NTC computer simulation/wargame of NTC, providing a statistical ``what-if '' capability for NTC scenarios. This mathematical formulation is ripe for control-theoretic extension to include human factors, a methodology previously developed in the context of teleoperated vehicles. Similar NTC scenarios differing at crucial decision points will be used for data to model the inuence of decision making on combat. The results may then be used to improve present human factors and C 2 algorithms in computer simulations/wargames. Our approach is to ``subordinate'' the SMC nonlinear stochastic equations, fitted to NTC scenarios, to establish the zeroth order description of that combat. In practice, an equivalent mathematical-physics representation is used, more suitable for numerical and formal work, i.e., a Lagrangian representation. Theoretically, these equations are nested within a larger set of nonlinear stochastic operator-equations which include C 3 human factors, e.g., supervisory decisions. In this study, we propose to perturb this operator theory about the SMC zeroth order set of equations. Then, subsets of scenarios fit to zeroth order, originally considered to be similarly degenerate, can be further split perturbatively to distinguish C 3 decision-making inuences. New methods of Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (VFSR), developed in the previous project, will be used for fitting these models to empirical data. ","Title: Statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions: Training and testing canonical momenta indicators of EEG  
Abstract: A series of papers has developed a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), deriving aggregate behavior of experimentally observed columns of neurons from statistical electrical-chemical properties of synaptic interactions. While not useful to yield insights at the single neuron level, SMNI has demonstrated its capability in describing large-scale properties of short-term memory and electroencephalographic (EEG) systematics. The necessity of including nonlinear and stochastic structures in this development has been stressed. Sets of EEG and evoked potential data were fit, collected to investigate genetic predispositions to alcoholism and to extract brain signatures of short-term memory. Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), a global optimization algorithm, was used to perform maximum likelihood fits of Lagrangians defined by path integrals of multivariate conditional probabilities. Canonical momenta indicators (CMI) are thereby derived for individual's EEG data. The CMI give better signal recognition than the raw data, and can be used to advantage as correlates of behavioral states. These results give strong quantitative support for an accurate intuitive picture, portraying neocortical interactions as having common algebraic or physics mechanisms that scale across quite disparate spatial scales and functional or behavioral phenomena, i.e., describing interactions among neurons, columns of neurons, and regional masses of neurons. This paper adds to these previous investigations two important aspects, a description of how the CMI may be used in source localization, and calculations using previously ASA-fitted parameters in out-of-sample data.

Abstract: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 1996. The official version of this paper has been published by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (http://www.aaai.org) c fl 1996, American Association for Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved. Abstract We describe the results of performing data mining on a challenging medical diagnosis domain, acute abdominal pain. This domain is well known to be difficult, yielding little more than 60% predictive accuracy for most human and machine diagnosticians. Moreover, many researchers argue that one of the simplest approaches, the naive Bayesian classifier, is optimal. By comparing the performance of the naive Bayesian classifier to its more general cousin, the Bayesian network classifier, and to selective Bayesian classifiers with just 10% of the total attributes, we show that the simplest models perform at least as well as the more complex models. We argue that simple models like the selective naive Bayesian classifier will perform as well as more complicated models for similarly complex domains with relatively small data sets, thereby calling into question the extra expense necessary to induce more complex models. ","Title: Efficient Learning of Selective Bayesian Network Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computation-ally efficient method for inducing selective Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach is to use information-theoretic metrics to efficiently select a subset of attributes from which to learn the classifier. We explore three conditional, information-theoretic met-rics that are extensions of metrics used extensively in decision tree learning, namely Quin-lan's gain and gain ratio metrics and Man-taras's distance metric. We experimentally show that the algorithms based on gain ratio and distance metric learn selective Bayesian networks that have predictive accuracies as good as or better than those learned by existing selective Bayesian network induction approaches (K2-AS), but at a significantly lower computational cost. We prove that the subset-selection phase of these information-based algorithms has polynomial complexity, as compared to the worst-case exponential time complexity of the corresponding phase in K2-AS.",1
"Title: Ensemble Learning and Evidence Maximization  
Abstract: Ensemble learning by variational free energy minimization is a tool introduced to neural networks by Hinton and van Camp in which learning is described in terms of the optimization of an ensemble of parameter vectors. The optimized ensemble is an approximation to the posterior probability distribution of the parameters. This tool has now been applied to a variety of statistical inference problems. In this paper I study a linear regression model with both parameters and hyper-parameters. I demonstrate that the evidence approximation for the optimization of regularization constants can be derived in detail from a free energy minimization viewpoint. ","Title: A VIEW OF THE EM ALGORITHM THAT JUSTIFIES INCREMENTAL, SPARSE, AND OTHER VARIANTS  
Abstract: The EM algorithm performs maximum likelihood estimation for data in which some variables are unobserved. We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible. ",1

"Title: Toward Simulated Evolution of Machine-Language Iteration  
Abstract: We use a simulated evolution search (genetic programming) for the automatic synthesis of small iterative machine-language programs. For an integer register machine with an addition instruction as its sole arithmetic operator, we show that genetic programming can produce exact and general multiplication routines by synthesizing the necessary iterative control structures from primitive machine-language instructions. Our program representation is a virtual register machine that admits arbitrary control flow. Our evolution strategy furthermore does not artificially restrict the synthesis of any control structure; we only place an upper bound on program evaluation time. A program's fitness is the distance between the output produced by a test case and the desired output (multiplication). The test cases exhaustively cover multiplication over a finite subset of the natural numbers (N 10 ); yet the derived solutions constitute general multiplication for the positive integers. For this problem, simulated evolution with a two-point crossover operator examines significantly fewer individuals in finding a solution than random search. Introduction of a small rate of mutation fur ther increases the number of solutions.","Title: Learning Recursive Sequences via Evolution of Machine-Language Programs  
Abstract: We use directed search techniques in the space of computer programs to learn recursive sequences of positive integers. Specifically, the integer sequences of squares, x 2 ; cubes, x 3 ; factorial, x!; and Fibonacci numbers are studied. Given a small finite prefix of a sequence, we show that three directed searches|machine-language genetic programming with crossover, exhaustive iterative hill climbing, and a hybrid (crossover and hill climbing)|can automatically discover programs that exactly reproduce the finite target prefix and, moreover, that correctly produce the remaining sequence up to the underlying machine's precision. Our machine-language representation is generic|it contains instructions for arithmetic, register manipulation and comparison, and control flow. We also introduce an output instruction that allows variable-length sequences as result values. Importantly, this representation does not contain recursive operators; recursion, when needed, is automatically synthesized from primitive instructions. For a fixed set of search parameters (e.g., instruction set, program size, fitness criteria), we compare the efficiencies of the three directed search techniques on the four sequence problems. For this parameter set, an evolutionary-based search always outperforms exhaustive hill climbing as well as undirected random search. Since only the prefix of the target sequence is variable in our experiments, we posit that this approach to sequence induction is potentially quite general. ",1
"Title: Generalized Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic-programming and Reinforcement-learning Algorithms  
Abstract: The problem of maximizing the expected total discounted reward in a completely observable Markovian environment, i.e., a Markov decision process (mdp), models a particular class of sequential decision problems. Algorithms have been developed for making optimal decisions in mdps given either an mdp specification or the opportunity to interact with the mdp over time. Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling. Central to the results are the contraction property of the value operator and a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence. ","Title: MultiPlayer Residual Advantage Learning With General Function Approximation  
Abstract: A new algorithm, advantage learning, is presented that improves on advantage updating by requiring that a single function be learned rather than two. Furthermore, advantage learning requires only a single type of update, the learning update, while advantage updating requires two different types of updates, a learning update and a normilization update. The reinforcement learning system uses the residual form of advantage learning. An application of reinforcement learning to a Markov game is presented. The testbed has continuous states and nonlinear dynamics. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. On each time step , each player chooses one of two possible actions; turn left or turn right, resulting in a 90 degree instantaneous change in the aircraft s heading. Reinforcement is given only when the missile hits the plane or the plane reaches an escape distance from the missile. The advantage function is stored in a single-hidden-layer sigmoidal network. Speed of learning is increased by a new algorithm , Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD), which extends Jacobs (1988) Delta-Delta for use in incremental training, and differs from Suttons Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (1992) in that it does not require the use of a trace and is amenable for use with general function approximation systems. The advantage learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Empirical results gathered using the missile/aircraft testbed validate theory that suggests residual forms of reinforcement learning algorithms converge to a local minimum of the mean squared Bellman residual when using general function approximation systems. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first time an approximate second order method has been used with residual algorithms. Empirical results are presented comparing convergence rates with and without the use of IDD for the reinforcement learning testbed described above and for a supervised learning testbed. The results of these experiments demonstrate IDD increased the rate of convergence and resulted in an order of magnitude lower total asymptotic error than when using backpropagation alone. ",1
"Title: Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories  
Abstract: The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``ow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair awed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.","Title: Theory Refinement Combining Analytical and Empirical Methods  
Abstract: This article describes a comprehensive approach to automatic theory revision. Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory. The system has been tested in a variety of application domains, and results are presented for problems in the domains of molecular biology and plant disease diagnosis. ",1
"Title: Forward models: Supervised learning with a distal teacher  
Abstract: Internal models of the environment have an important role to play in adaptive systems in general and are of particular importance for the supervised learning paradigm. In this paper we demonstrate that certain classical problems associated with the notion of the ""teacher"" in supervised learning can be solved by judicious use of learned internal models as components of the adaptive system. In particular, we show how supervised learning algorithms can be utilized in cases in which an unknown dynamical system intervenes between actions and desired outcomes. Our approach applies to any supervised learning algorithm that is capable of learning in multi-layer networks. *This paper is a revised version of MIT Center for Cognitive Science Occasional Paper #40.

","Title: Simulation-Assisted Learning by Competition: Effects of Noise Differences Between Training Model and Target Environment  
Abstract: The problem of learning decision rules for sequential tasks is addressed, focusing on the problem of learning tactical plans from a simple flight simulator where a plane must avoid a missile. The learning method relies on the notion of competition and employs genetic algorithms to search the space of decision policies. Experiments are presented that address issues arising from differences between the simulation model on which learning occurs and the target environment on which the decision rules are ultimately tested. Specifically, either the model or the target environment may contain noise. These experiments examine the effect of learning tactical plans without noise and then testing the plans in a noisy environment, and the effect of learning plans in a noisy simulator and then testing the plans in a noise-free environment. Empirical results show that, while best result are obtained when the training model closely matches the target environment, using a training environment that is more noisy than the target environment is better than using using a training environment that has less noise than the target environment.

"Title: A proposal for variable selection in the Cox model  
Abstract: GMD Report #633 Abstract Many of the current artificial neural network systems have serious limitations, concerning accessibility, flexibility, scaling and reliability. In order to go some way to removing these we suggest a reflective neural network architecture. In such an architecture, the modular structure is the most important element. The building-block elements are called ""minos' modules. They perform self-observation and inform on the current level of development, or scope of expertise, within the module. A Pandemonium system integrates such submodules so that they work together to handle mapping tasks. Network complexity limitations are attacked in this way with the Pandemonium problem decomposition paradigm, and both static and dynamic unreliability of the whole Pandemonium system is effectively eliminated through the generation and interpretation of confidence and ambiguity measures at every moment during the development of the system. Two problem domains are used to test and demonstrate various aspects of our architecture. Reliability and quality measures are defined for systems that only answer part of the time. Our system achieves better quality values than single networks of larger size for a handwritten digit problem. When both second and third best answers are accepted, our system is left with only 5% error on the test set, 2.1% better than the best single net. It is also shown how the system can elegantly learn to handle garbage patterns. With the parity problem it is demonstrated how complexity of problems may be decomposed automatically by the system, through solving it with networks of size smaller than a single net is required to be. Even when the system does not find a solution to the parity problem, because networks of too small a size are used, the reliability remains around 99-100%. Our Pandemonium architecture gives more power and flexibility to the higher levels of a large hybrid system than a single net system can, offering useful information for higher-level feedback loops, through which reliability of answers may be intelligently traded for less reliable but important ""intuitional"" answers. In providing weighted alternatives and possible generalizations, this architecture gives the best possible service to the larger system of which it will form part. ","Title: Hyperplane Dynamics as a Means to Understanding Back-Propagation Learning and Network Plasticity  
Abstract: The processing performed by a feed-forward neural network is often interpreted through use of decision hyperplanes at each layer. The adaptation process, however, is normally explained using the picture of gradient descent of an error landscape. In this paper the dynamics of the decision hyperplanes is used as the model of the adaptation process. A electro-mechanical analogy is drawn where the dynamics of hyperplanes is determined by interaction forces between hyperplanes and the particles which represent the patterns. Relaxation of the system is determined by increasing hyperplane inertia (mass). This picture is used to clarify the dynamics of learning, and to go some way to explaining learning deadlocks and escaping from certain local minima. Furthermore network plasticity is introduced as a dynamic property of the system, and its reduction as a necessary consequence of information storage. Hyper-plane inertia is used to explain and avoid destructive relearning in trained networks. ",1
"Title: Integrated Architectures for Learning, Planning, and Reacting Based on Approximating Dynamic Programming  
Abstract: This paper extends previous work with Dyna, a class of architectures for intelligent systems based on approximating dynamic programming methods. Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.","Title: A Comparison of Action Selection Learning Methods  
Abstract: Our goal is to develop a hybrid cognitive model of how humans acquire skills on complex cognitive tasks. We are pursuing this goal by designing hybrid computational architectures for the NRL Navigation task, which requires competent senso-rimotor coordination. In this paper, we empirically compare two methods for control knowledge acquisition (reinforcement learning and a novel variant of action models), as well as a hybrid of these methods, with human learning on this task. Our results indicate that the performance of our action models approach more closely approximates the rate of human learning on the task than does reinforcement learning or the hybrid. We also experimentally explore the impact of background knowledge on system performance. By adding knowledge used by the action models system to the benchmark reinforcement learner, we elevate its performance above that of the action models system. ",1

"Title: On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms  
Abstract: Recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning have yielded a number of new algorithms for the prediction and control of Markovian environments. These algorithms, including the TD() algorithm of Sutton (1988) and the Q-learning algorithm of Watkins (1989), can be motivated heuristically as approximations to dynamic programming (DP). In this paper we provide a rigorous proof of convergence of these DP-based learning algorithms by relating them to the powerful techniques of stochastic approximation theory via a new convergence theorem. The theorem establishes a general class of convergent algorithms to which both TD() and Q-learning belong.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that a technique called error-correcting output coding (ECOC) can dramatically improve the classification accuracy of supervised learning algorithms that learn to classify data points into one of k 2 classes. In this paper, we will extend the technique so that ECOC can also provide class probability information. ECOC is a method of converting k-class supervised learning problem into a large number L of two-class supervised learning problems and then combining the results of these L evaluations. The underlying two-class supervised learning algorithms are assumed to provide L probability estimates. The problem of computing class probabilities is formulated as an over-constrained system of L linear equations. Least squares methods are applied to solve these equations. Accuracy and reliability of the probability estimates are demonstrated.",1
"Title: Acquiring Recursive and Iterative Concepts with Explanation-Based Learning explanation-based generalization, generalizing explanation structures, generalizing to
Abstract: University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Technical Report 876 (September 1989) Abstract In explanation-based learning, a specific problem's solution is generalized into a form that can be later used to solve conceptually similar problems. Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning. ","Title: Hierarchical Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning (EBRL) was introduced by Dietterich and Flann as a way of combining the ability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn optimal plans with the generalization ability of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) (Di-etterich & Flann, 1995). We extend this work to domains where the agent must order and achieve a sequence of subgoals in an optimal fashion. Hierarchical EBRL can effectively learn optimal policies in some of these sequential task domains even when the subgoals weakly interact with each other. We also show that when a planner that can achieve the individual subgoals is available, our method converges even faster. ",1

Abstract: Concepts learned by neural networks are difficult to understand because they are represented using large assemblages of real-valued parameters. One approach to understanding trained neural networks is to extract symbolic rules that describe their classification behavior. There are several existing rule-extraction approaches that operate by searching for such rules. We present a novel method that casts rule extraction not as a search problem, but instead as a learning problem. In addition to learning from training examples, our method exploits the property that networks can be efficiently queried. We describe algorithms for extracting both conjunctive and M -of-N rules, and present experiments that show that our method is more efficient than conventional search-based approaches.",1
"Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods Based on `Slicing' the Density Function  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 9722, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. One way to sample from a distribution is to sample uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice' defined by the current vertical position. Variations on such `slice sampling' methods can easily be implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling, and may be more efficient than easily-constructed versions of the Metropolis algorithm. Slice sampling is therefore attractive in routine Markov chain Monte Carlo applications, and for use by software that automatically generates a Markov chain sampler from a model specification. One can also easily devise overrelaxed versions of slice sampling, which sometimes greatly improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walk behaviour. Random walks can also be avoided in some slice sampling schemes that simultaneously update all variables. ","Title: Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications  
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration.",1
"Title: Coordination and Control Structures and Processes: Possibilities for Connectionist Networks (CN)  
Abstract: The absence of powerful control structures and processes that synchronize, coordinate, switch between, choose among, regulate, direct, modulate interactions between, and combine distinct yet interdependent modules of large connectionist networks (CN) is probably one of the most important reasons why such networks have not yet succeeded at handling difficult tasks (e.g. complex object recognition and description, complex problem-solving, planning). In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways. We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations, and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones; the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost. ","Title: Analysis of Decision Boundaries Generated by Constructive Neural Network Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: Constructive learning algorithms offer an approach to incremental construction of near-minimal artificial neural networks for pattern classification. Examples of such algorithms include Tower, Pyramid, Upstart, and Tiling algorithms which construct multilayer networks of threshold logic units (or, multilayer perceptrons). These algorithms differ in terms of the topology of the networks that they construct which in turn biases the search for a decision boundary that correctly classifies the training set. This paper presents an analysis of such algorithms from a geometrical perspective. This analysis helps in a better characterization of the search bias employed by the different algorithms in relation to the geometrical distribution of examples in the training set. Simple experiments with non linearly separable training sets support the results of mathematical analysis of such algorithms. This suggests the possibility of designing more efficient constructive algorithms that dynamically choose among different biases to build near-minimal networks for pattern classification. ",1
"Title: Linear Space Induction in First Order Logic with RELIEFF  
Abstract: Current ILP algorithms typically use variants and extensions of the greedy search. This prevents them to detect significant relationships between the training objects. Instead of myopic impurity functions, we propose the use of the heuristic based on RELIEF for guidance of ILP algorithms. At each step, in our ILP-R system, this heuristic is used to determine a beam of candidate literals. The beam is then used in an exhaustive search for a potentially good conjunction of literals. From the efficiency point of view we introduce interesting declarative bias which enables us to keep the growth of the training set, when introducing new variables, within linear bounds (linear with respect to the clause length). This bias prohibits cross-referencing of variables in variable dependency tree. The resulting system has been tested on various artificial problems. The advantages and deficiencies of our approach are discussed. ","Title: Naive Bayesian classifier within ILP-R  
Abstract: When dealing with the classification problems, current ILP systems often lag behind state-of-the-art attributional learners. Part of the blame can be ascribed to a much larger hypothesis space which, therefore, cannot be as thoroughly explored. However, sometimes it is due to the fact that ILP systems do not take into account the probabilistic aspects of hypotheses when classifying unseen examples. This paper proposes just that. We developed a naive Bayesian classifier within our ILP-R first order learner. The learner itself uses a clever RELIEF based heuristic which is able to detect strong dependencies within the literal space when such dependencies exist. We conducted a series of experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. The results show that the combination of ILP-R together with the naive Bayesian classifier sometimes significantly improves the classification of unseen instances as measured by both classification accuracy and average information score.",1
"Title: Modeling Cortical Plasticity Based on Adapting Lateral Interaction  
Abstract: A neural network model called LISSOM for the cooperative self-organization of afferent and lateral connections in cortical maps is applied to modeling cortical plasticity. After self-organization, the LISSOM maps are in a dynamic equilibrium with the input, and reorganize like the cortex in response to simulated cortical lesions and intracortical microstimulation. The model predicts that adapting lateral interactions are fundamental to cortical reorganization, and suggests techniques to hasten recovery following sensory cortical surgery. ","Title: A Neural Network Model of Visual Tilt Aftereffects  
Abstract: RF-LISSOM, a self-organizing model of laterally connected orientation maps in the primary visual cortex, was used to study the psychological phenomenon known as the tilt aftereffect. The same self-organizing processes that are responsible for the long-term development of the map and its lateral connections are shown to result in tilt aftereffects over short time scales in the adult. The model allows observing large numbers of neurons and connections simultaneously, making it possible to relate higher-level phenomena to low-level events, which is difficult to do experimentally. The results give computational support for the idea that direct tilt aftereffects arise from adaptive lateral interactions between feature detectors, as has long been surmised. They also suggest that indirect effects could result from the conservation of synaptic resources during this process. The model thus provides a unified computational explanation of self-organization and both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects in the primary visual cortex. ",1
"Title: Solving the Multiple-Instance Problem with Axis-Parallel Rectangles  
Abstract: The multiple instance problem arises in tasks where the training examples are ambiguous: a single example object may have many alternative feature vectors (instances) that describe it, and yet only one of those feature vectors may be responsible for the observed classification of the object. This paper describes and compares three kinds of algorithms that learn axis-parallel rectangles to solve the multiple-instance problem. Algorithms that ignore the multiple instance problem perform very poorly. An algorithm that directly confronts the multiple instance problem (by attempting to identify which feature vectors are responsible for the observed classifications) performs best, giving 89% correct predictions on a musk-odor prediction task. The paper also illustrates the use of artificial data to debug and compare these algorithms.

We assume that there is an unknown product distribution D over Q d such that all instances are independently drawn according to D. The accuracy of a hypothesis is measured by the probability that it would incorrectly predict whether one of n more points drawn from D was in the rectangle to be learned. Our algorithm achieves accuracy * with probability 1 ffi in ",1
"Title: Learning Context-free Grammars: Capabilities and Limitations of a Recurrent Neural Network with an External Stack Memory  
Abstract: This work describes an approach for inferring Deterministic Context-free (DCF) Grammars in a Connectionist paradigm using a Recurrent Neural Network Pushdown Automaton (NNPDA). The NNPDA consists of a recurrent neural network connected to an external stack memory through a common error function. We show that the NNPDA is able to learn the dynamics of an underlying pushdown automaton from examples of grammatical and non-grammatical strings. Not only does the network learn the state transitions in the automaton, it also learns the actions required to control the stack. In order to use continuous optimization methods, we develop an analog stack which reverts to a discrete stack by quantization of all activations, after the network has learned the transition rules and stack actions. We further show an enhancement of the network's learning capabilities by providing hints. In addition, an initial comparative study of simulations with first, second and third order recurrent networks has shown that the increased degree of freedom in a higher order networks improve generalization but not necessarily learning speed. ","Title: Finite State Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks Automata and Dynamical Systems Approaches  
Abstract: Decision Trees have been widely used for classification/regression tasks. They are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks and are understandable by humans. In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree.",1

"Title: Towards Automatic Discovery of Building Blocks in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for the discovery of building blocks in genetic programming (GP) called adaptive representation through learning (ARL). The central idea of ARL is the adaptation of the problem representation, by extending the set of terminals and functions with a set of evolvable subroutines. The set of subroutines extracts common knowledge emerging during the evolutionary process and acquires the necessary structure for solving the problem. ARL supports subroutine creation and deletion. Subroutine creation or discovery is performed automatically based on the differential parent-offspring fitness and block activation. Subroutine deletion relies on a utility measure similar to schema fitness over a window of past generations. The technique described is tested on the problem of controlling an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment. The automatic discovery of subroutines can help scale up the GP technique to complex problems. ","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: A Case Study of Case-Based CBR  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning depends on multiple knowledge sources beyond the case library, including knowledge about case adaptation and criteria for similarity assessment. Because hand coding this knowledge accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. However, despite early interest in case-based approaches to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require, and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources. The paper closes with general lessons about case-based CBR and areas for future research.","Title: Case-Based Learning: Beyond Classification of Feature Vectors

"Title: Defining Explanation in Probabilistic Systems  
Abstract: As probabilistic systems gain popularity and are coming into wider use, the need for a mechanism that explains the system's findings and recommendations becomes more critical. The system will also need a mechanism for ordering competing explanations. We examine two representative approaches to explanation in the literature one due to G ardenfors and one due to Pearland show that both suffer from significant problems. We propose an approach to defining a notion of better explanation that combines some of the features of both together with more recent work by Pearl and others on causality.","Title: Abduction as Belief Revision  
Abstract: We propose a model of abduction based on the revision of the epistemic state of an agent. Explanations must be sufficient to induce belief in the sentence to be explained (for instance, some observation), or ensure its consistency with other beliefs, in a manner that adequately accounts for factual and hypothetical sentences. Our model will generate explanations that nonmonotonically predict an observation, thus generalizing most current accounts, which require some deductive relationship between explanation and observation. It also provides a natural preference ordering on explanations, defined in terms of normality or plausibility. To illustrate the generality of our approach, we reconstruct two of the key paradigms for model-based diagnosis, abductive and consistency-based diagnosis, within our framework. This reconstruction provides an alternative semantics for both and extends these systems to accommodate our predictive explanations and semantic preferences on explanations. It also illustrates how more general information can be incorporated in a principled manner. fl Some parts of this paper appeared in preliminary form as Abduction as Belief Revision: A Model of Preferred Explanations, Proc. of Eleventh National Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-93), Washington, DC, pp.642-648 (1993).

"Title: Recurrent Neural Networks for Missing or Asynchronous Data  
Abstract: In this paper we propose recurrent neural networks with feedback into the input units for handling two types of data analysis problems. On the one hand, this scheme can be used for static data when some of the input variables are missing. On the other hand, it can also be used for sequential data, when some of the input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies. Unlike in the case of probabilistic models (e.g. Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network does not attempt to model the distribution of the missing variables given the observed variables. Instead it is a more ""discriminant"" approach that fills in the missing variables for the sole purpose of minimizing a learning criterion (e.g., to minimize an output error).","Title: Supervised learning from incomplete data via an EM approach

"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers have proved remarkably popular as tools for Bayesian computation. However, problems can arise in their application when the density of interest is high dimensional and strongly correlated. In these circumstances the sampler may be slow to traverse the state space and mixing is poor. In this article we offer a partial solution to this problem. The state space of the Markov chain is augmented to accommodate multiple chains in parallel. Updates to individual chains are based around a genetic style crossover operator acting on `parent' states drawn from the population of chains. This process makes efficient use of gradient information implicitly encoded within the distribution of states across the population. Empirical studies support the claim that the crossover operator acting on a parallel population of chains improves mixing. This is illustrated with an example of sampling a high dimensional posterior probability density from a complex predictive model. By adopting a latent variable approach the methodology is extended to deal with variable selection and model averaging in high dimensions. This is illustrated with an example of knot selection for a spline interpolant. ",1
"Title: Cross-Validation and the Bootstrap: Estimating the Error Rate of a Prediction Rule  
Abstract: A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased, but can be highly variable. This article discusses bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. A particular bootstrap method, the 632+ rule, is shown to substantially outperform cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric, and apply to any possible prediction rule: however we only study classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include ""smooth"" prediction rules like Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function, and unsmooth ones like Nearest Neighbors.","Title: Combining estimates in regression and classification

Abstract: We add internal memory to the XCS classifier system. We then test XCS with internal memory, named XCSM, in non-Markovian environments with two and four aliasing states. Experimental results show that XCSM can easily converge to optimal solutions in simple environments; moreover, XCSM's performance is very stable with respect to the size of the internal memory involved in learning. However, the results we present evidence that in more complex non-Markovian environments, XCSM may fail to evolve an optimal solution. Our results suggest that this happens because, the exploration strategies currently employed with XCS, are not adequate to guarantee the convergence to an optimal policy with XCSM, in complex non-Markovian environments.

"Title: Toward Efficient Agnostic Learning  
Abstract: In this paper we initiate an investigation of generalizations of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model that attempt to significantly weaken the target function assumptions. The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables. ","Title: Robust Trainability of Single Neurons  
Abstract: We propose a model of efficient on-line reinforcement learning based on the expected mistake bound framework introduced by Haussler, Littlestone and Warmuth (1987). The measure of performance we use is the expected difference between the total reward received by the learning agent and that received by an agent behaving optimally from the start. We call this expected difference the cumulative mistake of the agent and we require that it ""levels off"" at a reasonably fast rate as the learning progresses. We show that this model is polynomially equivalent to the PAC model of off-line reinforcement learning introduced in (Fiechter, 1994). In particular we show how an off-line PAC reinforcement learning algorithm can be transformed into an efficient on-line algorithm in a simple and practical way. An immediate consequence of this result is that the PAC algorithm for the general finite state-space reinforcement learning problem described in (Fiechter, 1994) can be transformed into a polynomial on-line al gorithm with guaranteed performances.",1

Abstract: Dimensions of complexity raised during the definition of a system aimed at supporting the planning of initial attack to forest fires are presented and discussed. The complexity deriving from the highly dynamic and unpredictable domain of forest fire, the one realated to the individuation and integration of planning techniques suitable to this domain, the complexity of addressing the problem of taking into account the role of the user to be supported by the system and finally the complexity of an architecture able to integrate different subsystems. In particular we focus on the severe constraints to the definition of a planning approach posed by the fire fighting domain, constraints which cannot be satisfied completely by any of the current planning paradigms. We propose an approach based on the integratation of skeletal planning and case based reasoning techniques with constraint reasoning. More specifically temporal constraints are used in two steps of the planning process: plan fitting and adaptation, and resource scheduling.

"Title: Beyond Independence: Conditions for the Optimality of the Simple Bayesian Classifier  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC) is commonly thought to assume that attributes are independent given the class, but this is apparently contradicted by the surprisingly good performance it exhibits in many domains that contain clear attribute dependences. No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this finding lies in the distinction between classification and probability estimation: correct classification can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several sufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. The paper also reports empirical evidence of the SBC's competitive performance in domains containing substantial degrees of attribute dependence. ","Title: Issues in the Integration of Data Mining and Data Visualization Visualizing the Simple Bayesian Classifier  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC), sometimes called Naive-Bayes, is built based on a conditional independence model of each attribute given the class. The model was previously shown to be surprisingly robust to obvious violations of this independence assumption, yielding accurate classification models even when there are clear conditional dependencies. The SBC can serve as an excellent tool for initial exploratory data analysis when coupled with a visualizer that makes its structure comprehensible. We describe such a visual representation of the SBC model that has been successfully implemented. We describe the requirements we had for such a visualization and the design decisions we made to satisfy them. ",1
"Title: Type Inheritance in Strongly Typed Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper appears as chapter 18 of Kenneth E. Kinnear, Jr. and Peter J. Angeline, editors Advances in Genetic Programming 2, MIT Press, 1996. Abstract Genetic Programming (GP) is an automatic method for generating computer programs, which are stored as data structures and manipulated to evolve better programs. An extension restricting the search space is Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP), which has, as a basic premise, the removal of closure by typing both the arguments and return values of functions, and by also typing the terminal set. A restriction of STGP is that there are only two levels of typing. We extend STGP by allowing a type hierarchy, which allows more than two levels of typing. ","Title: Modeling Distributed Search via Social Insects  
Abstract: Complex group behavior arises in social insects colonies as the integration of the actions of simple and redundant individual insects [Adler and Gordon, 1992, Oster and Wilson, 1978]. Furthermore, the colony can act as an information center to expedite foraging [Brown, 1989]. We apply these lessons from natural systems to model collective action and memory in a computational agent society. Collective action can expedite search in combinatorial optimization problems [Dorigo et al., 1996]. Collective memory can improve learning in multi-agent systems [Garland and Alterman, 1996]. Our collective adaptation integrates the simplicity of collective action with the pattern detection of collective memory to significantly improve both the gathering and processing of knowledge. As a test of the role of the society as an information center, we examine the ability of the society to distribute task allocation without any omnipotent centralized control. ",1
"Title: The Role of Development in Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: A Genetic Algorithm Tutorial Darrell Whitley Technical Report CS-93-103 (Revised) November 10, 1993 ","Title: Evolution in Time and Space The Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modifications compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.",1
"Title: Using Case-Based Reasoning as a Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimization with Changing Criteria  
Abstract: Practical optimization problems such as job-shop scheduling often involve optimization criteria that change over time. Repair-based frameworks have been identified as flexible computational paradigms for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. Since the control problem of repair-based optimization is severe, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques can be potentially helpful. However, some of the fundamental assumptions made by traditional RL algorithms are not valid for repair-based optimization. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) compensates for some of the limitations of traditional RL approaches. In this paper, we present a Case-Based Reasoning RL approach, implemented in the C A B I N S system, for repair-based optimization. We chose job-shop scheduling as the testbed for our approach. Our experimental results show that C A B I N S is able to effectively solve problems with changing optimization criteria which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base. ","Title: Transfer of Learning by Composing Solutions of Elemental Sequential Tasks  
Abstract: Although building sophisticated learning agents that operate in complex environments will require learning to perform multiple tasks, most applications of reinforcement learning have focussed on single tasks. In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs. I provide a proof of one aspect of the learning algorithm. ",1
"Title: A VIEW OF THE EM ALGORITHM THAT JUSTIFIES INCREMENTAL, SPARSE, AND OTHER VARIANTS  
Abstract: The EM algorithm performs maximum likelihood estimation for data in which some variables are unobserved. We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible. ","Title: Free energy coding  In  
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the problem of optimal compression when a source code produces multiple codewords for a given symbol. It may seem that the most sensible codeword to use in this case is the shortest one. However, in the proposed free energy approach, random codeword selection yields an effective codeword length that can be less than the shortest codeword length. If the random choices are Boltzmann distributed, the effective length is optimal for the given source code. The expectation-maximization parameter estimation algorithms minimize this effective codeword length. We illustrate the performance of free energy coding on a simple problem where a compression factor of two is gained by using the new method. ",1

Abstract: Locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) is a popular instance-based algorithm for learning continuous non-linear mappings. For more than two or three inputs and for more than a few thousand dat-apoints the computational expense of predictions is daunting. We discuss drawbacks with previous approaches to dealing with this problem, and present a new algorithm based on a multiresolution search of a quickly-constructible augmented kd-tree. Without needing to rebuild the tree, we can make fast predictions with arbitrary local weighting functions, arbitrary kernel widths and arbitrary queries. The paper begins with a new, faster, algorithm for exact LWPR predictions. Next we introduce an approximation that achieves up to a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup with negligible accuracy losses. Increasing a certain approximation parameter achieves greater speedups still, but with a correspondingly larger accuracy degradation. This is nevertheless useful during operations such as the early stages of model selection and locating optima of a fitted surface. We also show how the approximations can permit real-time query-specific optimization of the kernel width. We conclude with a brief discussion of potential extensions for tractable instance-based learning on datasets that are too large to fit in a com puter's main memory. ",1
"Title: Solving 3-SAT by GAs Adapting Constraint Weights  
Abstract: Handling NP complete problems with GAs is a great challenge. In particular the presence of constraints makes finding solutions hard for a GA. In this paper we present a problem independent constraint handling mechanism, Stepwise Adaptation of Weights (SAW), and apply it for solving the 3-SAT problem. Our experiments prove that the SAW mechanism substantially increases GA performance. Furthermore, we compare our SAW-ing GA with the best heuristic technique we could trace, WGSAT, and conclude that the GA is superior to the heuristic method.

"Title: WEAK CONVERGENCE AND OPTIMAL SCALING OF RANDOM WALK METROPOLIS ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm, in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. ","Title: FROM METROPOLIS TO DIFFUSIONS: GIBBS STATES AND OPTIMAL SCALING  
Abstract: This paper investigates the behaviour of the random walk Metropolis algorithm in high dimensional problems. Here we concentrate on the case where the components in the target density is a spatially homogeneous Gibbs distribution with finite range. The performance of the algorithm is strongly linked to the presence or absence of phase transition for the Gibbs distribution; the convergence time being approximately linear in dimension for problems where phase transition is not present. Related to this, there is an optimal way to scale the variance of the proposal distribution in order to maximise the speed of convergence of the algorithm. This turns out to involve scaling the variance of the proposal as the reciprocal of dimension (at least in the phase transition free case). Moreover the actual optimal scaling can be characterised in terms of the overall acceptance rate of the algorithm, the maximising value being 0:234, the value as predicted by studies on simpler classes of target density. The results are proved in the framework of a weak convergence result, which shows that the algorithm actually behaves like an infinite dimensional diffusion process in high dimensions. 1.

"Title: The RISE System: Conquering Without Separating  
Abstract: Current rule induction systems (e.g. CN2) typically rely on a ""separate and conquer"" strategy, learning each rule only from still-uncovered examples. This results in a dwindling number of examples being available for learning successive rules, adversely affecting the system's accuracy. An alternative is to learn all rules simultaneously, using the entire training set for each. This approach is implemented in the Rise 1.0 system. Empirical comparison of Rise with CN2 suggests that ""conquering without separating"" performs similarly to its counterpart in simple domains, but achieves increasingly substantial gains in accuracy as the domain difficulty grows. ","Title: Rule Induction with CN2: Some Recent Improvements  
Abstract: The CN2 algorithm induces an ordered list of classification rules from examples using entropy as its search heuristic. In this short paper, we describe two improvements to this algorithm. Firstly, we present the use of the Laplacian error estimate as an alternative evaluation function and secondly, we show how unordered as well as ordered rules can be generated. We experimentally demonstrate significantly improved performances resulting from these changes, thus enhancing the usefulness of CN2 as an inductive tool. Comparisons with Quinlan's C4.5 are also made. ",1
"Title: Concept Learning and the Problem of Small  
Abstract:  ","Title: On Learning Multiple Descriptions of a Concept  
Abstract: In sparse data environments, greater classification accuracy can be achieved by learning several concept descriptions of the data and combining their classifications. Stochastic search is a general tool which can be used to generate many good concept descriptions (rule sets) for each class in the data. Bayesian probability theory offers an optimal strategy for combining classifications of the individual concept descriptions, and here we use an approximation of that theory. This strategy is most useful when additional data is difficult to obtain and every increase in classification accuracy is important. The primary result of this paper is that multiple concept descriptions are particularly helpful in ""flat"" hypothesis spaces in which there are many equally good ways to grow a rule, each having similar gain. Another result is experimental evidence that learning multiple rule sets yields more accurate classifications than learning multiple rules for some domains. To demonstrate these behaviors, we learn multiple concept descriptions by adapting HYDRA, a noise-tolerant relational learning algorithm. ",1
"Title: Team-Partitioned, Opaque-Transition Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel multi-agent learning paradigm called team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL). TPOT-RL introduces the concept of using action-dependent features to generalize the state space. In our work, we use a learned action-dependent feature space. TPOT-RL is an effective technique to allow a team of agents to learn to cooperate towards the achievement of a specific goal. It is an adaptation of traditional RL methods that is applicable in complex, non-Markovian, multi-agent domains with large state spaces and limited training opportunities. Multi-agent scenarios are opaque-transition, as team members are not always in full communication with one another and adversaries may affect the environment. Hence, each learner cannot rely on having knowledge of future state transitions after acting in the world. TPOT-RL enables teams of agents to learn effective policies with very few training examples even in the face of a large state space with large amounts of hidden state. The main responsible features are: dividing the learning task among team members, using a very coarse, action-dependent feature space, and allowing agents to gather reinforcement directly from observation of the environment. TPOT-RL is fully implemented and has been tested in the robotic soccer domain, a complex, multi-agent framework. This paper presents the algorithmic details of TPOT-RL as well as empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed multi-agent learning approach with learned features.","Title: Markov games as a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning  
Abstract: In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalization of reinforcement learning, a single adaptive agent interacts with an environment defined by a probabilistic transition function. In this solipsistic view, secondary agents can only be part of the environment and are therefore fixed in their behavior. The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals. This paper considers a step in this direction in which exactly two agents with diametrically opposed goals share an environment. It describes a Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimal policies and demonstrates its application to a simple two-player game in which the optimal policy is probabilistic.",1
"Title: Robot Shaping: Developing Situated Agents through Learning  
Abstract: Learning plays a vital role in the development of situated agents. In this paper, we explore the use of reinforcement learning to ""shape"" a robot to perform a predefined target behavior. We connect both simulated and real robots to A LECSYS, a parallel implementation of a learning classifier system with an extended genetic algorithm. After classifying different kinds of Animat-like behaviors, we explore the effects on learning of different types of agent's architecture (monolithic, flat and hierarchical) and of training strategies. In particular, hierarchical architecture requires the agent to learn how to coordinate basic learned responses. We show that the best results are achieved when both the agent's architecture and the training strategy match the structure of the behavior pattern to be learned. We report the results of a number of experiments carried out both in simulated and in real environments, and show that the results of simulations carry smoothly to real robots. While most of our experiments deal with simple reactive behavior, in one of them we demonstrate the use of a simple and general memory mechanism. As a whole, our experimental activity demonstrates that classifier systems with genetic algorithms can be practically employed to develop autonomous agents. ","Title: GENETIC AND NON GENETIC OPERATORS IN ALECSYS

Dynamical adjustment of the classifiers set cardinality, in order to speed up the performance phase of the algorithm.

Abstract: covering has been formalized and used extensively. In this work, the divide-and-conquer technique is formalized as well and compared to the covering technique in a logic programming framework. Covering works by repeatedly specializing an overly general hypothesis, on each iteration focusing on finding a clause with a high coverage of positive examples. Divide-and-conquer works by specializing an overly general hypothesis once, focusing on discriminating positive from negative examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that there are cases when more accurate hypotheses can be found by divide-and-conquer than by covering. Moreover, since covering considers the same alternatives repeatedly it tends to be less efficient than divide-and-conquer, which never considers the same alternative twice. On the other hand, covering searches a larger hypothesis space, which may result in that more compact hypotheses are found by this technique than by divide-and-conquer. Furthermore, divide-and-conquer is, in contrast to covering, not applicable to learn ing recursive definitions.","Title: A Competitive Approach to Game Learning  
Abstract: Machine learning of game strategies has often depended on competitive methods that continually develop new strategies capable of defeating previous ones. We use a very inclusive definition of game and consider a framework within which a competitive algorithm makes repeated use of a strategy learning component that can learn strategies which defeat a given set of opponents. We describe game learning in terms of sets H and X of first and second player strategies, and connect the model with more familiar models of concept learning. We show the importance of the ideas of teaching set [20] and specification number [19] k in this new context. The performance of several competitive algorithms is investigated, using both worst-case and randomized strategy learning algorithms. Our central result (Theorem 4) is a competitive algorithm that solves games in a total number of strategies polynomial in lg(jHj), lg(jX j), and k. Its use is demonstrated, including an application in concept learning with a new kind of counterexample oracle.

"Title: Learning Boolean Read-Once Formulas over Generalized Bases  
Abstract: A read-once formula is one in which each variable appears on at most a single input. Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski give a polynomial time algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to identify exactly read-once boolean formulas over the basis fAND; OR; NOTg [AHK93]. The goal of this work is to consider natural generalizations of these gates, in order to develop exact identification algorithms for more powerful classes of formulas. We show that read-once formulas over a basis of arbitrary boolean functions of constant fan-in k or less (i.e. any f : f0; 1g 1ck ! f0; 1g) are exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. We show that read-once formulas over the basis of arbitrary symmetric boolean functions are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time in this model. Given standard cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial time identification algorithm for read-twice formulas over either of these bases using membership and equivalence queries. We further show that for any basis class B meeting certain technical conditions, any polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over B can be extended to a polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over the union of B and the arbitrary functions of fan-in k or less. As a result, read-once formulas over the union of arbitrary symmetric and arbitrary constant fan-in gates are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries.

We use our analysis tool to illustrate classes of mean-square-error curve behavior in a variety of example reward processes, and we show that although the various temporal difference algorithms are quite sensitive to the choice of step-size and eligibility-trace parameters, there are values of these parameters that make them similarly competent, and generally good.

Abstract: Planning and learning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is a key problem for artificial intelligence. In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent common-sense higher-level actions, such as going to lunch, grasping an object, or flying to Denver. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models [Sutton, 1995] and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning. We introduce a more general form of temporally abstract model, the multi-time model, and establish its suitability for planning and learning by virtue of its relationship to the Bellman equations. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of multi-time models and illustrates their potential advantages in a The need for hierarchical and abstract planning is a fundamental problem in AI (see, e.g., Sacerdoti, 1977; Laird et al., 1986; Korf, 1985; Kaelbling, 1993; Dayan & Hinton, 1993). Model-based reinforcement learning offers a possible solution to the problem of integrating planning with real-time learning and decision-making (Peng & Williams, 1993, Moore & Atkeson, 1993; Sutton and Barto, 1998). However, current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent common-sense, higher-level actions. Modeling such actions requires the ability to handle different, interrelated levels of temporal abstraction. A new approach to modeling at multiple time scales was introduced by Sutton (1995) based on prior work by Singh , Dayan , and Sutton and Pinette . This approach enables models of the environment at different temporal scales to be intermixed, producing temporally abstract models. However, that work was concerned only with predicting the environment. This paper summarizes an extension of the approach including actions and control of the environment [Precup & Sutton, 1997]. In particular, we generalize the usual notion of a gridworld planning task.",1

Abstract: The Perfect Phylogeny Problem is a classical problem in computational evolutionary biology, in which a set of species/taxa is described by a set of qualitative characters. In recent years, the problem has been shown to be NP-Complete in general, while the different fixed parameter versions can each be solved in polynomial time. In particular, Agarwala and Fernandez-Baca have developed an O(2 3r (nk 3 +k 4 )) algorithm for the perfect phylogeny problem for n species defined by k r-state characters. Since commonly the character data is drawn from alignments of molecular sequences, k is the length of the sequences and can thus be very large (in the hundreds or thousands). Thus, it is imperative to develop algorithms which run efficiently for large values of k. In this paper we make additional observations about the structure of the problem and produce an algorithm for the problem that runs in time O(2 2r k 2 n). We also show how it is possible to efficiently build a structure that implicitly represents the set of all perfect phylogenies, and to randomly sample from that set.",1
"Title: Incremental Class Learning approach and its application to Handwritten Digit Recognition  
Abstract: Incremental Class Learning (ICL) provides a feasible framework for the development of scalable learning systems. Instead of learning a complex problem at once, ICL focuses on learning subproblems incrementally, one at a time | using the results of prior learning for subsequent learning | and then combining the solutions in an appropriate manner. With respect to multi-class classification problems, the ICL approach presented in this paper can be summarized as follows. Initially the system focuses on one category. After it learns this category, it tries to identify a compact subset of features (nodes) in the hidden layers, that are crucial for the recognition of this category. The system then freezes these crucial nodes (features) by fixing their incoming weights. As a result, these features cannot be obliterated in subsequent learning. These frozen features are available during subsequent learning and can serve as parts of weight structures build to recognize other categories. As more categories are learned, the set of features gradually stabilizes and learning a new category requires less effort. Eventually, learning a new category may only involve combining existing features in an appropriate manner. The approach promotes the sharing of learned features among a number of categories and also alleviates the well-known catastrophic interference problem. We present results of applying the ICL approach to the Handwritten Digit Recognition problem, based on a spatio-temporal representation of patterns.

"Title: The Power of Decision Tables  
Abstract: We evaluate the power of decision tables as a hypothesis space for supervised learning algorithms. Decision tables are one of the simplest hypothesis spaces possible, and usually they are easy to understand. Experimental results show that on artificial and real-world domains containing only discrete features, IDTM, an algorithm inducing decision tables, can sometimes outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as C4.5. Surprisingly, performance is quite good on some datasets with continuous features, indicating that many datasets used in machine learning either do not require these features, or that these features have few values. We also describe an incremental method for performing cross-validation that is applicable to incremental learning algorithms including IDTM. Using incremental cross-validation, it is possible to cross-validate a given dataset and IDTM in time that is linear in the number of instances, the number of features, and the number of label values. The time for incremental cross-validation is independent of the number of folds chosen, hence leave-one-out cross-validation and ten-fold cross-validation take the same time. ","Title: Compression-Based Feature Subset Selection  Keywords: Minimum Description Length Principle, Cross Validation, Noise  
Abstract: Irrelevant and redundant features may reduce both predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of induced concepts. Most common Machine Learning approaches for selecting a good subset of relevant features rely on cross-validation. As an alternative, we present the application of a particular Minimum Description Length (MDL) measure to the task of feature subset selection. Using the MDL principle allows taking into account all of the available data at once. The new measure is information-theoretically plausible and yet still simple and therefore efficiently computable. We show empirically that this new method for judging the value of feature subsets is more efficient than and performs at least as well as methods based on cross-validation. Domains with both a large number of training examples and a large number of possible features yield the biggest gains in efficiency. Thus our new approach seems to scale up better to large learning problems than previous methods. ",1
"Title: Fast Probabilistic Modeling for Combinatorial Optimization  
Abstract: Probabilistic models have recently been utilized for the optimization of large combinatorial search problems. However, complex probabilistic models that attempt to capture inter-parameter dependencies can have prohibitive computational costs. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed COMIT, provides a method for using probabilistic models in conjunction with fast search techniques. We show how COMIT can be used with two very different fast search algorithms: hillclimbing and Population-based incremental learning (PBIL). The resulting algorithms maintain many of the benefits of probabilistic modeling, with far less computational expense. Extensive empirical results are provided; COMIT has been successfully applied to jobshop scheduling, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems. This paper also presents a review of probabilistic modeling for combi natorial optimization.","Title: MIMIC: Finding Optima by Estimating Probability Densities  
Abstract: In many optimization problems, the structure of solutions reflects complex relationships between the different input parameters. For example, experience may tell us that certain parameters are closely related and should not be explored independently. Similarly, experience may establish that a subset of parameters must take on particular values. Any search of the cost landscape should take advantage of these relationships. We present MIMIC, a framework in which we analyze the global structure of the optimization landscape. A novel and efficient algorithm for the estimation of this structure is derived. We use knowledge of this structure to guide a randomized search through the solution space and, in turn, to refine our estimate of the structure. Our technique obtains significant speed gains over other randomized optimization procedures. ",1
"Title: A Brief History of Connectionism  
Abstract: Connectionist research is firmly established within the scientific community, especially within the multi-disciplinary field of cognitive science. This diversity, however, has created an environment which makes it difficult for connectionist researchers to remain aware of recent advances in the field, let alone understand how the field has developed. This paper attempts to address this problem by providing a brief guide to connectionist research. The paper begins by defining the basic tenets of connectionism. Next, the development of connectionist research is traced, commencing with connectionism's philosophical predecessors, moving to early psychological and neuropsychological influences, followed by the mathematical and computing contributions to connectionist research. Current research is then reviewed, focusing specifically on the different types of network architectures and learning rules in use. The paper concludes by suggesting that neural network research|at least in cognitive science|should move towards models that incorporate the relevant functional principles inherent in neurobiological systems. ","Title: Constructing Deterministic Finite-State Automata in Recurrent Neural Networks  
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deteriorating performance when tested on long strings. This deteriorating performance can be attributed to the instability of the internal representation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidal discriminant function together with the recurrent structure contribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, i.e. the constructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols, the constructive algorithm generates a ""programmed"" neural network with O(n) neurons and O(mn) weights. We compare our algorithm to other methods proposed in the literature. ",1
"Title: A VIEW OF THE EM ALGORITHM THAT JUSTIFIES INCREMENTAL, SPARSE, AND OTHER VARIANTS  
Abstract: The EM algorithm performs maximum likelihood estimation for data in which some variables are unobserved. We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible. ","Title: On Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures  
Abstract: We build up the mathematical connection between the ""Expectation-Maximization"" (EM) algorithm and gradient-based approaches for maximum likelihood learning of finite Gaussian mixtures. We show that the EM step in parameter space is obtained from the gradient via a projection matrix P , and we provide an explicit expression for the matrix. We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface. Based on these mathematical results, we present a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of EM and other algorithms for the learning of Gaussian mixture models.

"Title: LEARNING FACTORIAL CODES BY PREDICTABILITY MINIMIZATION (Neural Computation, 4(6):863-879, 1992)  
Abstract: I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter `abstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle which aim at finding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e. codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The final part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences.","Title: SEMILINEAR PREDICTABILITY MINIMIZATION PRODUCES WELL-KNOWN FEATURE DETECTORS Neural Computation, 1996 (accepted)  
Abstract: Predictability minimization (PM | Schmidhuber, 1992) exhibits various intuitive and theoretical advantages over many other methods for unsupervised redundancy reduction. So far, however, there were only toy applications of PM. In this paper, we apply semilinear PM to static real world images and find: without a teacher and without any significant preprocessing, the system automatically learns to generate distributed representations based on well-known feature detectors, such as orientation sensitive edge detectors and off-center-on-surround-like structures, thus extracting simple features related to those considered useful for image pre-processing and compression.",1
"Title: Learning policies for partially observable environments: Scaling up  
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (pomdp's) model decision problems in which an agent tries to maximize its reward in the face of limited and/or noisy sensor feedback. While the study of pomdp's is motivated by a need to address realistic problems, existing techniques for finding optimal behavior do not appear to scale well and have been unable to find satisfactory policies for problems with more than a dozen states. After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding near-optimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains.","Title: Some Experiments with Real-time Decision Algorithms

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient, reliable shotgun sequence assembly algorithm based on a fingerprinting scheme that is robust to both noise and repetitive sequences in the data. Our algorithm uses exact matches of short patterns randomly selected from fragment data to identify fragment overlaps, construct an overlap map, and finally deliver a consensus sequence. We show how statistical clues made explicit in our approach can easily be exploited to correctly assemble results even in the presence of extensive repetitive sequences. Our approach is exceptionally fast in practice: e.g., we have successfully assembled a whole Mycoplasma genitalium genome (approximately 580 kbps) in roughly 8 minutes of 64MB 200MHz Pentium Pro CPU time from real shotgun data, where most existing algorithms can be expected to run for several hours to a day on the same data. Moreover, experiments with shotgun data synthetically prepared from real DNA sequences from a wide range of organisms (including human DNA) and containing extensive repeating regions demonstrate our algorithm's robustness to noise and the presence of repetitive sequences. For example, we have correctly assembled a 238kbp Human DNA sequence in less than 3 minutes of 64MB 200MHz Pentium Pro CPU time. fl Support for this research was provided in part by the Office of Naval Research through grant N0014-94-1-1178.",1

Abstract: To appear in: G. Tesauro, D. S. Touretzky and T. K. Leen, eds., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 7, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1995. A straightforward approach to the curse of dimensionality in reinforcement learning and dynamic programming is to replace the lookup table with a generalizing function approximator such as a neural net. Although this has been successful in the domain of backgammon, there is no guarantee of convergence. In this paper, we show that the combination of dynamic programming and function approximation is not robust, and in even very benign cases, may produce an entirely wrong policy. We then introduce Grow-Support, a new algorithm which is safe from divergence yet can still reap the benefits of successful generalization.","Title: Robust Value Function Approximation by Working Backwards Computing an accurate value function is the key
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the intuition that TD() is meant to operate by approximating asynchronous value iteration. We note that on the important class of discrete acyclic stochastic tasks, value iteration is inefficient compared with the DAG-SP algorithm, which essentially performs only one sweep instead of many by working backwards from the goal. The question we address in this paper is whether there is an analogous algorithm that can be used in large stochastic state spaces requiring function approximation. We present such an algorithm, analyze it, and give comparative results to TD on several domains. the state). Using VI to solve MDPs belonging to either of these special classes can be quite inefficient, since VI performs backups over the entire space, whereas the only backups useful for improving V fl are those on the ""frontier"" between already-correct and not-yet-correct V fl values. In fact, there are classical algorithms for both problem classes which compute V fl more efficiently by explicitly working backwards: for the deterministic class, Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm; and for the acyclic class, Directed-Acyclic-Graph-Shortest-Paths (DAG-SP) [6]. 1 DAG-SP first topologically sorts the MDP, producing a linear ordering of the states in which every state x precedes all states reachable from x. Then, it runs through that list in reverse, performing one backup per state. Worst-case bounds for VI, Dijkstra, and DAG-SP in deterministic domains with X states and A actions/state are 1 Although [6] presents DAG-SP only for deterministic acyclic problems, it applies straightforwardly to the ",1

The improved results suggest that nonlinear feature extraction from wavelet representations outperforms different linear choices of basis functions. ",1
"Title: Interpretation of Complex Scenes Using Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: In most object recognition systems, interactions between objects in a scene are ignored and the best interpretation is considered to be the set of hypothesized objects that matches the greatest number of image features. We show how image interpretation can be cast as the problem of finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in a Bayesian network that models both visual and physical object interactions. The problem of how to determine exact conditional probabilities for the network is shown to be unimportant, since the goal is to find the most probable configuration of objects, not to calculate absolute probabilities. We furthermore show that evaluating configurations by feature counting is equivalent to calculating the joint probability of the configuration using a restricted Bayesian network, and derive the assumptions about probabilities necessary to make a Bayesian formulation reasonable.","Title: Efficient Inference in Bayes Networks As A Combinatorial Optimization Problem  
Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. The techniques used in these algorithms are closely related to network structures and some of them are not easy to understand and implement. In this paper, we consider the problem from the combinatorial optimization point of view and state that efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network is a problem of finding an optimal factoring given a set of probability distributions. From this viewpoint, previously developed algorithms can be seen as alternate factoring strategies. In this paper, we define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and demonstrate simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance. ",1
"Title: A Trade Network Game With Endogenous Partner Selection 1  
Abstract: This paper develops an evolutionary trade network game (TNG) that combines evolutionary game play with endogenous partner selection. Successive generations of resource-constrained buyers and sellers choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continually updated expected payoffs. Trade partner selection takes place in accordance with a modified Gale-Shapley matching mechanism, and trades are implemented using trade strategies evolved via a standardly specified genetic algorithm. The trade partnerships resulting from the matching mechanism are shown to be core stable and Pareto optimal in each successive trade cycle. Nevertheless, computer experiments suggest that these static optimality properties may be inadequate measures of optimality from an evolutionary perspective.

"Title: Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: This paper reviews five statistical tests for determining whether one learning algorithm outperforms another on a particular learning task. These tests are compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type 1 error). Two widely-used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of Type I error in certain situations and should never be used. These tests are (a) a test for the difference of two proportions and (b) a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train/test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of Type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low Type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5x2cv, based on 5 iterations of 2-fold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has good Type I error. The paper also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The 5x2cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, McNemar's test is the only test with acceptable Type I error. For algorithms that can be executed ten times, the 5x2cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.

"Title: Introspective reasoning using meta-explanations for multistrategy learning  
Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a reasoner must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires declarative representations of meta-knowledge of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task, of the system's knowledge, and of the organization of this knowledge. This chapter presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during a performance task, declarative representations of these failures, and associations between failures and particular learning strategies. The theory is based on Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types, formulate learning goals, and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. The theory is implemented in a computer model of an introspective reasoner that performs multistrategy learning during a story understanding task.

Abstract: Reading has been studied for decades by a variety of cognitive disciplines, yet no theories exist which sufficiently describe and explain how people accomplish the complete task of reading real-world texts. In particular, a type of knowledge intensive reading known as creative reading has been largely ignored by the past research. We argue that creative reading is an aspect of practically all reading experiences; as a result, any theory which overlooks this will be insufficient. We have built on results from psychology, artificial intelligence, and education in order to produce a functional theory of the complete reading process. The overall framework describes the set of tasks necessary for reading to be performed. Within this framework, we have developed a theory of creative reading. The theory is implemented in the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Creativity) system, a reading system which reads science fiction stories. ",1
"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

Measures of complexity of solution trees are defined for an adaptive representation framework.

"Title: TO IMPROVE FORECASTING  
Abstract: Working Paper IS-97-007, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. In: Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance 6 (1998) 14-23. (Special Issue on ""Improving Generalization of Nonlinear Financial Forecasting Models"".) http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~aweigend/Research/Papers/InteractionLayer Abstract. Predictive models for financial data are often based on a large number of plausible inputs that are potentially nonlinearly combined to yield the conditional expectation of a target, such as a daily return of an asset. This paper introduces a new architecture for this task: On the output side, we predict dynamical variables such as first derivatives and curvatures on different time spans. These are subsequently combined in an interaction output layer to form several estimates of the variable of interest. Those estimates are then averaged to yield the final prediction. Independently from this idea, on the input side, we propose a new internal preprocessing layer connected with a diagonal matrix of positive weights to a layer of squashing functions. These weights adapt for each input individually and learn to squash outliers in the input. We apply these two ideas to the real world example of the daily predictions of the German stock index DAX (Deutscher Aktien Index), and compare the results to a network with a single output. The new six layer architecture is more stable in training due to two facts: (1) More information is flowing back from the outputs to the input in the backward pass; (2) The constraint of predicting first and second derivatives focuses the learning on the relevant variables for the dynamics. The architectures are compared from both the training perspective (squared errors, robust errors), and from the trading perspective (annualized returns, percent correct, Sharpe ratio). ","Title: Modeling Volatility using State Space Models  
Abstract: In time series problems, noise can be divided into two categories: dynamic noise which drives the process, and observational noise which is added in the measurement process, but does not influence future values of the system. In this framework, empirical volatilities (the squared relative returns of prices) exhibit a significant amount of observational noise. To model and predict their time evolution adequately, we estimate state space models that explicitly include observational noise. We obtain relaxation times for shocks in the logarithm of volatility ranging from three weeks (for foreign exchange) to three to five months (for stock indices). In most cases, a two-dimensional hidden state is required to yield residuals that are consistent with white noise. We compare these results with ordinary autoregressive models (without a hidden state) and find that autoregressive models underestimate the relaxation times by about two orders of magnitude due to their ignoring the distinction between observational and dynamic noise. This new interpretation of the dynamics of volatility in terms of relaxators in a state space model carries over to stochastic volatility models and to GARCH models, and is useful for several problems in finance, including risk management and the pricing of derivative securities.

"Title: Book Review  Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation Reviewed by: 2  
Abstract: Neural computation, also called connectionism, parallel distributed processing, neural network modeling or brain-style computation, has grown rapidly in the last decade. Despite this explosion, and ultimately because of impressive applications, there has been a dire need for a concise introduction from a theoretical perspective, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of connectionist approaches and establishing links to other disciplines, such as statistics or control theory. The Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation by Hertz, Krogh and Palmer (subsequently referred to as HKP) is written from the perspective of physics, the home discipline of the authors. The book fulfills its mission as an introduction for neural network novices, provided that they have some background in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. It covers a number of models that are often viewed as disjoint.

Abstract: The sensorimotor integration system can be viewed as an observer attempting to estimate its own state and the state of the environment by integrating multiple sources of information. We describe a computational framework capturing this notion, and some specific models of integration and adaptation that result from it. Psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems, subserving the integration and adaptation of visuo-auditory maps, and estimation of the state of the hand during arm movements, are presented and analyzed within this framework. These results suggest that: (1) Spatial information from visual and auditory systems is integrated so as to reduce the variance in localization. (2) The effects of a remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space can be predicted from a simple learning rule. (3) The temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state is captured by a linear dynamic observer, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm.

Abstract: We provide analytical expressions governing changes to the bias and variance of the lookup table estimators provided by various Monte Carlo and temporal difference value estimation algorithms with o*ine updates over trials in absorbing Markov reward processes. We have used these expressions to develop software that serves as an analysis tool: given a complete description of a Markov reward process, it rapidly yields an exact mean-square-error curve, the curve one would get from averaging together sample mean-square-error curves from an infinite number of learning trials on the given problem. We use our analysis tool to illustrate classes of mean-square-error curve behavior in a variety of example reward processes, and we show that although the various temporal difference algorithms are quite sensitive to the choice of step-size and eligibility-trace parameters, there are values of these parameters that make them similarly competent, and generally good. ","Title: Planning with Closed-Loop Macro Actions  
Abstract: Planning and learning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is a key problem for artificial intelligence. In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Conventional model-based reinforcement learning uses primitive actions that last one time step and that can be modeled independently of the learning agent. These can be generalized to macro actions, multi-step actions specified by an arbitrary policy and a way of completing. Macro actions generalize the classical notion of a macro operator in that they are closed loop, uncertain, and of variable duration. Macro actions are needed to represent common-sense higher-level actions such as going to lunch, grasping an object, or traveling to a distant city. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models (Sutton 1995) and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning. We define a semantics of models of macro actions that guarantees the validity of planning using such models. This paper present new results in the theory of planning with macro actions and illustrates its potential advantages in a gridworld task. ",1

Abstract: This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian networks with missing values and hidden variables from the perspective of recent work in on-line learning [12]. We provide a unified framework for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, our framework encompasses both the gradient projection algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame ters than does standard EM.",1
"Title: A Survey of Parallel Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: IlliGAL Report No. 97003 May 1997 ","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: An Overview of Genetic Algorithms Part 1, Fundamentals  
Abstract: Mathematical programming approaches to three fundamental problems will be described: feature selection, clustering and robust representation. The feature selection problem considered is that of discriminating between two sets while recognizing irrelevant and redundant features and suppressing them. This creates a lean model that often generalizes better to new unseen data. Computational results on real data confirm improved generalization of leaner models. Clustering is exemplified by the unsupervised learning of patterns and clusters that may exist in a given database and is a useful tool for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). A mathematical programming formulation of this problem is proposed that is theoretically justifiable and computationally implementable in a finite number of steps. A resulting k-Median Algorithm is utilized to discover very useful survival curves for breast cancer patients from a medical database. Robust representation is concerned with minimizing trained model degradation when applied to new problems. A novel approach is proposed that purposely tolerates a small error in the training process in order to avoid overfitting data that may contain errors. Examples of applications of these concepts are given.","Title: A Case Study on Tuning of Genetic Algorithms by Using Performance Evaluation Based on Experimental Design  
Abstract: This paper proposes four performance measures of a genetic algorithm (GA) which enable us to compare different GAs for an op timization problem and different choices of their parameters' values. The performance measures are defined in terms of observations in simulation, such as the frequency of optimal solutions, fitness values, the frequency of evolution leaps, and the number of generations needed to reach an optimal solution. We present a case study in which parameters of a GA for robot path planning was tuned and its performance was optimized through performance evaluation by using the measures. Especially, one of the performance measures is used to demonstrate the adaptivity of the GA for robot path planning. We also propose a process of systematic tuning based on techniques for the design of experiments. ",1
"Title: A Comparative Study of ID3 and Backpropagation for English Text-to-Speech Mapping  
Abstract: The performance of the error backpropagation (BP) and ID3 learning algorithms was compared on the task of mapping English text to phonemes and stresses. Under the distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, it is shown that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task by several percentage points. Three hypotheses explaining this difference were explored: (a) ID3 is overfitting the training data, (b) BP is able to share hidden units across several output units and hence can learn the output units better, and (c) BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not. We conclude that only hypothesis (c) is correct. By augmenting ID3 with a simple statistical learning procedure, the performance of BP can be approached but not matched. More complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP and ID3 substantially. A study of the residual errors suggests that there is still substantial room for improvement in learning methods for text-to-speech mapping.","Title: Draft Symbolic Representation of Neural Networks

"Title: Priors and Component Structures in Autoregressive Time Series Models  
Abstract: New approaches to prior specification and structuring in autoregressive time series models are introduced and developed. We focus on defining classes of prior distributions for parameters and latent variables related to latent components of an autoregressive model for an observed time series. These new priors naturally permit the incorporation of both qualitative and quantitative prior information about the number and relative importance of physically meaningful components that represent low frequency trends, quasi-periodic sub-processes, and high frequency residual noise components of observed series. The class of priors also naturally incorporates uncertainty about model order, and hence leads in posterior analysis to model order assessment and resulting posterior and predictive inferences that incorporate full uncertainties about model order as well as model parameters. Analysis also formally incorporates uncertainty, and leads to inferences about, unknown initial values of the time series, as it does for predictions of future values. Posterior analysis involves easily implemented iterative simulation methods, developed and described here. One motivating applied field is climatology, where the evaluation of latent structure, especially quasi-periodic structure, is of critical importance in connection with issues of global climatic variability. We explore analysis of data from the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), one of several series that has been central in recent high-profile debates in the atmospheric sciences about recent apparent trends in climatic indicators.

Efficient model jumping is achieved by proposing model space moves from the full conditional density for the AR parameters, which is obtained analytically. This is compared with an alternative method, for which the moves are cheaper to compute, in which proposals are made only for the new parameters in each move.

"Title: Small Populations over Many Generations can beat Large Populations over Few Generations in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper looks at the use of small populations in Genetic Programming (GP), where the trend in the literature appears to be towards using as large a population as possible, which requires more memory resources and CPU-usage is less efficient. Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS) and Limited Error Fitness (LEF) are two different, adaptive variations of the standard supervised learning method used in GP. This paper compares the performance of GP, GP+DSS, and GP+LEF, on a 958 case classification problem, using a small population size of 50. A similar comparison between GP and GP+DSS is done on a larger and messier 3772 case classification problem. For both problems, GP+DSS with the small population size consistently produces a better answer using fewer tree evaluations than other runs using much larger populations. Even standard GP can be seen to perform well with the much smaller population size, indicating that it is certainly worth an exploratory run or three with a small population size before assuming that a large population size is necessary. It is an interesting notion that smaller can mean faster and better. ","Title: Tackling the Boolean Even N Parity Problem with Genetic Programming and Limited-Error Fitness standard GP
Abstract: This paper presents Limited Error Fitness (LEF), a modification to the standard supervised learning approach in Genetic Programming (GP), in which an individual's fitness score is based on how many cases remain uncovered in the ordered training set after the individual exceeds an error limit. The training set order and the error limit are both altered dynamically in response to the performance of the fittest individual in the previous generation. ",1
"Title: Evaluating and Improving Steady State Evolutionary Algorithms on Constraint Satisfaction Problems  
Abstract: The work in progress reported by Wright & Liley shows great promise, primarily because of their experimental and simulation paradigms. However, their tentative conclusion that macroscopic neocortex may be considered (approximately) a linear near-equilibrium system is premature and does not correspond to tentative conclusions drawn from other studies of neocortex. At this time, there exists an interdisciplinary multidimensional gradation on published studies of neocortex, with one primary dimension of mathematical physics represented by two extremes. At one extreme, there is much scientifically unsupported talk of chaos and quantum physics being responsible for many important macroscopic neocortical processes (involving many thousands to millions of neurons) (Wilczek, 1994). At another extreme, many non-mathematically trained neuroscientists uncritically lump all neocortical mathematical theory into one file, and consider only statistical averages of citations for opinions on the quality of that research (Nunez, 1995). In this context, it is important to appreciate that Wright and Liley (W&L) report on their scientifically sound studies on macroscopic neocortical function, based on simulation and a blend of sound theory and reproducible experiments. However, their pioneering work, given the absence of much knowledge of neocortex at this time, is open to criticism, especially with respect to their present inferences and conclusions. Their conclusion that EEG data exhibit linear near-equilibrium dynamics may very well be true, but only in the sense of focusing only on one local minima, possibly with individual-specific and physiological-state dependent ","Title: Graph Coloring with Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms  
Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on solving graph coloring problems with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). After testing different algorithm variants we conclude that the best option is an asexual EA using order-based representation and an adaptation mechanism that periodically changes the fitness function during the evolution. This adaptive EA is general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping GA on a wide range of problem instances with different size, topology and edge density. The results show that the adaptive EA is superior to the Grouping GA and outperforms DSatur on the hardest problem instances. Furthermore, it scales up better with the problem size than the other two algorithms and indicates a linear computational complexity. ",1
"Title: Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures  
Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

We label the example face images (and for the problem of face detection, ""near miss"" faces as well) with descriptive parameters for pose, expression, identity, and face vs. non-face. Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ",1

Abstract: In on-line character recognition we can observe two kinds of intra-class variations: small geometric deformations and completely different writing styles. We propose a new approach to deal with these problems by defining an extension of tangent distance [9], well known in off-line character recognition. The system has been implemented with a k-nearest neighbor classifier and a so called diabolo classifier [6] respectively. Both classifiers are invariant under transformations like rotation, scale or slope and can deal with variations in stroke order and writing direction. Results are presented for our digit database with more than 200 writers. ","Title: Adaptive Boosting of Neural Networks for Character Recognition  
Abstract: Technical Report #1072, D epartement d'Informatique et Recherche Op erationnelle, Universit e de Montr eal Abstract Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], in particular decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks applied to character recognition tasks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers.

"Title: Parzen. On estimation of a probability density function and mode. Annual Mathematical Statistics, 33:1065-1076, 1962.
Abstract: To apply the algorithm for classification we assign each class a separate set of codebook Gaussians. Each set is only trained with patterns from a single class. After having trained the codebook Gaussians, each set provides an estimate of the probability function of one class; just as with Parzen window estimation, we take as the estimate of the pattern distribution the average of all Gaussians in the set. Classification of a pattern may now be done by calculating the probability of each class at the respective sample point, and assigning to the pattern the class with the highest probability. Hence the whole codebook plays a role in the classification of patterns. This is not the case with regular classification schemes using codebooks. We have tested the classification scheme on several classification tasks including the two spiral problem. We compared our algorithm to various other classification algorithms and it came out second; the best algorithm for the applications is the Parzen window estimation. However, the computing time and memory for Parzen window estimation are excessive when compared to our algorithm, and hence, in practical situations, our algorithm is to be preferred. We have developed a fast algorithm which combines attractive properties of both Parzen window estimation and vector quantization. The scale parameter is tuned adaptively and, therefore, is not set in an ad hoc manner. It allows a classification strategy in which all the codebook vectors are taken into account. This yields better results than the standard vector quantization techniques. An interesting topic for further research is to use radially non-symmetric Gaussians. ","Title: Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes  
Abstract: Given a set of samples of a probability distribution on a set of discrete random variables, we study the problem of constructing a good approximative neural network model of the underlying probability distribution. Our approach is based on an unsupervised learning scheme where the samples are first divided into separate clusters, and each cluster is then coded as a single vector. These Bayesian prototype vectors consist of conditional probabilities representing the attribute-value distribution inside the corresponding cluster. Using these prototype vectors, it is possible to model the underlying joint probability distribution as a simple Bayesian network (a tree), which can be realized as a feedforward neural network capable of probabilistic reasoning. In this framework, learning means choosing the size of the prototype set, partitioning the samples into the corresponding clusters, and constructing the cluster prototypes. We describe how the prototypes can be determined, given a partition of the samples, and present a method for evaluating the likelihood of the corresponding Bayesian tree. We also present a greedy heuristic for searching through the space of different partition schemes with different numbers of clusters, aiming at an optimal approximation of the probability distribution.

Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.","Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine  
Abstract: The clausal discovery engine claudien is presented. claudien discovers regularities in data and is a representative of the inductive logic programming paradigm. As such, it represents data and regularities by means of first order clausal theories. Because the search space of clausal theories is larger than that of attribute value representation, claudien also accepts as input a declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities. Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique. In order to achieve this aim, we show how claudien can be used to learn 1) integrity constraints in databases, 2) functional dependencies and determinations, 3) properties of sequences, 4) mixed quantitative and qualitative laws, 5) reverse engineering, and 6) classification rules.

Second, we show how these concepts can be formed as internal nodes of decision trees, serving as a bias to the learner. Finally, we evaluate the method on several artificially generated and naturally occurring data sets to determine the effects of this bias.","Title: Effects of Different Types of New Attribute on Constructive Induction  
Abstract: This paper studies the effects on decision tree learning of constructing four types of attribute (conjunctive, disjunctive, Mof-N, and Xof-N representations). To reduce effects of other factors such as tree learning methods, new attribute search strategies, evaluation functions, and stopping criteria, a single tree learning algorithm is developed. With different option settings, it can construct four different types of new attribute, but all other factors are fixed. The study reveals that conjunctive and disjunctive representations have very similar performance in terms of prediction accuracy and theory complexity on a variety of concepts. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the stronger representation power of Mof-N than conjunction and disjunction and the stronger representation power of Xof-N than these three types of new attribute can be reflected in the performance of decision tree learning.

Behavioural consistency in turn impacts the ability of genetic programming to identify and promote appropriate subprograms. We present the results of modelling dependency through a parameterized problem in which a subprogram exhibits internal and external dependency levels that change as the subprogram is successively combined into larger subsolutions. We find that the key difference between non-existent and ""full"" external dependency is a longer time to solution identification and a lower likelihood of success as shown by increased difficulty in identifying and promoting correct subprograms.

"Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Independent vs. Cooperative Agents  
Abstract: Intelligent human agents exist in a cooperative social environment that facilitates learning. They learn not only by trial-and-error, but also through cooperation by sharing instantaneous information, episodic experience, and learned knowledge. The key investigations of this paper are, ""Given the same number of reinforcement learning agents, will cooperative agents outperform independent agents who do not communicate during learning?"" and ""What is the price for such cooperation?"" Using independent agents as a benchmark, cooperative agents are studied in following ways: (1) sharing sensation, (2) sharing episodes, and (3) sharing learned policies. This paper shows that (a) additional sensation from another agent is beneficial if it can be used efficiently, (b) sharing learned policies or episodes among agents speeds up learning at the cost of communication, and (c) for joint tasks, agents engaging in partnership can significantly outperform independent agents although they may learn slowly in the beginning. These tradeoffs are not just limited to multi-agent reinforcement learning.","Title: Team-Partitioned, Opaque-Transition Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel multi-agent learning paradigm called team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL). TPOT-RL introduces the concept of using action-dependent features to generalize the state space. In our work, we use a learned action-dependent feature space. TPOT-RL is an effective technique to allow a team of agents to learn to cooperate towards the achievement of a specific goal. It is an adaptation of traditional RL methods that is applicable in complex, non-Markovian, multi-agent domains with large state spaces and limited training opportunities. Multi-agent scenarios are opaque-transition, as team members are not always in full communication with one another and adversaries may affect the environment. Hence, each learner cannot rely on having knowledge of future state transitions after acting in the world. TPOT-RL enables teams of agents to learn effective policies with very few training examples even in the face of a large state space with large amounts of hidden state. The main responsible features are: dividing the learning task among team members, using a very coarse, action-dependent feature space, and allowing agents to gather reinforcement directly from observation of the environment. TPOT-RL is fully implemented and has been tested in the robotic soccer domain, a complex, multi-agent framework. This paper presents the algorithmic details of TPOT-RL as well as empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed multi-agent learning approach with learned features.",1

Abstract: DIMACS Technical Report 95-35 August 1995 ","Title: Combining Linear Discriminant Functions with Neural Networks for Supervised Learning  
Abstract: A novel supervised learning method is presented by combining linear discriminant functions with neural networks. The proposed method results in a tree-structured hybrid architecture. Due to constructive learning, the binary tree hierarchical architecture is automatically generated by a controlled growing process for a specific supervised learning task. Unlike the classic decision tree, the linear discriminant functions are merely employed in the intermediate level of the tree for heuristically partitioning a large and complicated task into several smaller and simpler subtasks in the proposed method. These subtasks are dealt with by component neural networks at the leaves of the tree accordingly. For constructive learning, growing and credit-assignment algorithms are developed to serve for the hybrid architecture. The proposed architecture provides an efficient way to apply existing neural networks (e.g. multi-layered perceptron) for solving a large scale problem. We have already applied the proposed method to a universal approximation problem and several benchmark classification problems in order to evaluate its performance. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method yields better results and faster training in comparison with the multi-layered perceptron.",1
"Title: Lookahead and Discretization in ILP  
Abstract: We present and evaluate two methods for improving the performance of ILP systems. One of them is discretization of numerical attributes, based on Fayyad and Irani's text [9], but adapted and extended in such a way that it can cope with some aspects of discretization that only occur in relational learning problems (when indeterminate literals occur). The second technique is lookahead. It is a well-known problem in ILP that a learner cannot always assess the quality of a refinement without knowing which refinements will be enabled afterwards, i.e. without looking ahead in the refinement lattice. We present a simple method for specifying when lookahead is to be used, and what kind of lookahead is interesting. Both the discretization and lookahead techniques are evaluated experimentally. The results show that both techniques improve the quality of the induced theory, while computational costs are acceptable.","Title: Multi-class problems and discretization in ICL Extended abstract  
Abstract: Handling multi-class problems and real numbers is important in practical applications of machine learning to KDD problems. While attribute-value learners address these problems as a rule, very few ILP systems do so. The few ILP systems that handle real numbers mostly do so by trying out all real values that are applicable, thus running into efficiency or overfitting problems. This paper discusses some recent extensions of ICL that address these problems. ICL, which stands for Inductive Constraint Logic, is an ILP system that learns first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples. The main charateristic of ICL is its view on examples. These are seen as interpretations which are true or false for the clausal target theory (in CNF). We first argue that ICL can be used for learning a theory in a disjunctive normal form (DNF). With this in mind, a possible solution for handling more than two classes is given (based on some ideas from CN2). Finally, we show how to tackle problems with continuous values by adapting discretization techniques from attribute value learners. ",1

"Title: Evolution in Time and Space The Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modifications compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.","Title: Self-Adaptation in Genetic Algorithms of external parameters of a GA is seen as a first

Stories both recommend a course of action and exemplify general conditions in which that recommendation is appropriate. A computational model of advice taking using stories must address two related problems: determining the story's recommendations and appropriateness conditions, and showing that these obtain in the new situation. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to the second problem based on caching the results of the first. Our proposal has been implemented in brainstormer, a planner that takes abstract advice. ","Title: Entailment for Specification Refinement  
Abstract: Specification refinement is part of formal program derivation, a method by which software is directly constructed from a provably correct specification. Because program derivation is an intensive manual exercise used for critical software systems, an automated approach would allow it to be viable for many other types of software systems. The goal of this research is to determine if genetic programming (GP) can be used to automate the specification refinement process. The initial steps toward this goal are to show that a well-known proof logic for program derivation can be encoded such that a GP-based system can infer sentences in the logic for proof of a particular sentence. The results are promising and indicate that GP can be useful in aiding pro gram derivation.",1
"Title: Tight Performance Bounds on Greedy Policies Based on Imperfect Value Functions  
Abstract: Consider a given value function on states of a Markov decision problem, as might result from applying a reinforcement learning algorithm. Unless this value function equals the corresponding optimal value function, at some states there will be a discrepancy, which is natural to call the Bellman residual, between what the value function specifies at that state and what is obtained by a one-step lookahead along the seemingly best action at that state using the given value function to evaluate all succeeding states. This paper derives a tight bound on how far from optimal the discounted return for a greedy policy based on the given value function will be as a function of the maximum norm magnitude of this Bellman residual. A corresponding result is also obtained for value functions defined on state-action pairs, as are used in Q-learning. One significant application of these results is to problems where a function approximator is used to learn a value function, with training of the approxi-mator based on trying to minimize the Bellman residual across states or state-action pairs. When control is based on the use of the resulting value function, this result provides a link between how well the objectives of function approximator training are met and the quality of the resulting control.

We argue that, although MDPs can be solved efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical algorithms for solving large problems quickly. To encourage future research, we sketch some alternative methods of analysis that rely on the struc ture of MDPs.",1

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms are direct random search algorithms which imitate the principles of natural evolution as a method to solve adaptation (learning) tasks in general. As such they have several features in common which can be observed on the genetic and phenotypic level of living species. In this paper the algorithms' capability of adaptation or learning in a wider sense is demonstrated, and it is focused on Genetic Algorithms to illustrate the learning process on the population level (first level learning), and on Evolution Strategies to demonstrate the learning process on the meta-level of strategy parameters (second level learning).","Title: Extended Selection Mechanisms in Genetic Algorithms

"Title: Effects of Occam's Razor in Evolving Sigma-Pi Neural Nets  
Abstract: Several evolutionary algorithms make use of hierarchical representations of variable size rather than linear strings of fixed length. Variable complexity of the structures provides an additional representational power which may widen the application domain of evolutionary algorithms. The price for this is, however, that the search space is open-ended and solutions may grow to arbitrarily large size. In this paper we study the effects of structural complexity of the solutions on their generalization performance by analyzing the fitness landscape of sigma-pi neural networks. The analysis suggests that smaller networks achieve, on average, better generalization accuracy than larger ones, thus confirming the usefulness of Occam's razor. A simple method for implementing the Occam's razor principle is described and shown to be effective in improv ing the generalization accuracy without limiting their learning capacity.","Title: Fitness Landscapes and Difficulty in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: The structure of the fitness landscape on which genetic programming operates is examined. The landscapes of a range of problems of known difficulty are analyzed in an attempt to determine which landscape measures correlate with the difficulty of the problem. The autocorrelation of the fitness values of random walks, a measure which has been shown to be related to perceived difficulty using other techniques, is only a weak indicator of the difficulty as perceived by genetic programming. All of these problems show unusually low autocorrelation. Comparison of the range of landscape basin depths at the end of adaptive walks on the landscapes shows good correlation with problem difficulty, over the entire range of problems examined. ",1
"Title: Learning Recursive Sequences via Evolution of Machine-Language Programs  
Abstract: We use directed search techniques in the space of computer programs to learn recursive sequences of positive integers. Specifically, the integer sequences of squares, x 2 ; cubes, x 3 ; factorial, x!; and Fibonacci numbers are studied. Given a small finite prefix of a sequence, we show that three directed searches|machine-language genetic programming with crossover, exhaustive iterative hill climbing, and a hybrid (crossover and hill climbing)|can automatically discover programs that exactly reproduce the finite target prefix and, moreover, that correctly produce the remaining sequence up to the underlying machine's precision. Our machine-language representation is generic|it contains instructions for arithmetic, register manipulation and comparison, and control flow. We also introduce an output instruction that allows variable-length sequences as result values. Importantly, this representation does not contain recursive operators; recursion, when needed, is automatically synthesized from primitive instructions. For a fixed set of search parameters (e.g., instruction set, program size, fitness criteria), we compare the efficiencies of the three directed search techniques on the four sequence problems. For this parameter set, an evolutionary-based search always outperforms exhaustive hill climbing as well as undirected random search. Since only the prefix of the target sequence is variable in our experiments, we posit that this approach to sequence induction is potentially quite general.

Abstract: In this paper we carefully formulate a Schema Theorem for Genetic Programming (GP) using a schema definition that accounts for the variable length and the non-homologous nature of GP's representation. In a manner similar to early GA research, we use interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP Building Block definition and to state a ""classical"" Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by hierarchically combining building blocks. We report that this approach is not convincing for several reasons: it is difficult to find support for the promotion and combination of building blocks solely by rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically questionable whether building blocks always exist because partial solutions of consistently above average fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured; also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account of GP search behavior.",1

Abstract: Dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs) are a useful tool for modeling complex stochastic processes. The simplest inference task in DPNs is monitoring | that is, computing a posterior distribution for the state variables at each time step given all observations up to that time. Recursive, constant-space algorithms are well-known for monitoring in DPNs and other models. This paper is concerned with hindsight | that is, computing a posterior distribution given both past and future observations. Hindsight is an essential subtask of learning DPN models from data. Existing algorithms for hindsight in DPNs use O(SN ) space and time, where N is the total length of the observation sequence and S is the state space size for each time step. They are therefore impractical for hindsight in complex models with long observation sequences. This paper presents an O(S log N ) space, O(SN log N ) time hindsight algorithm. We demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in two real-world DPN learning problems. We also discuss the possibility of an O(S)-space, O(SN )-time algorithm. ",1
"Title: Transfer of Learning by Composing Solutions of Elemental Sequential Tasks  
Abstract: Although building sophisticated learning agents that operate in complex environments will require learning to perform multiple tasks, most applications of reinforcement learning have focussed on single tasks. In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs. I provide a proof of one aspect of the learning algorithm. ","Title: Using Case-Based Reasoning as a Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimization with Changing Criteria  
Abstract: Practical optimization problems such as job-shop scheduling often involve optimization criteria that change over time. Repair-based frameworks have been identified as flexible computational paradigms for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. Since the control problem of repair-based optimization is severe, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques can be potentially helpful. However, some of the fundamental assumptions made by traditional RL algorithms are not valid for repair-based optimization. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) compensates for some of the limitations of traditional RL approaches. In this paper, we present a Case-Based Reasoning RL approach, implemented in the C A B I N S system, for repair-based optimization. We chose job-shop scheduling as the testbed for our approach. Our experimental results show that C A B I N S is able to effectively solve problems with changing optimization criteria which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base.

"Title: Learning High Utility Rules by Incorporating Search Control  Guidance Committee  
Abstract: In this paper we extend the basic autologistic model to include covariates and an indication of sampling effort. The model is applied to sampled data instead of the traditional use for image analysis where complete data are available. We adopt a Bayesian set-up and develop a hybrid Gibbs sampling estimation procedure. Using simulated examples, we show that the autologistic model with covariates for sample data improves predictions as compared to the simple logistic regression model and the standard autologistic model (without covariates). ","Title: A Statistical Approach to Solving the EBL Utility Problem  
Abstract: Many ""learning from experience"" systems use information extracted from problem solving experiences to modify a performance element PE, forming a new element PE 0 that can solve these and similar problems more efficiently. However, as transformations that improve performance on one set of problems can degrade performance on other sets, the new PE 0 is not always better than the original PE; this depends on the distribution of problems. We therefore seek the performance element whose expected performance, over this distribution, is optimal. Unfortunately, the actual distribution, which is needed to determine which element is optimal, is usually not known. Moreover, the task of finding the optimal element, even knowing the distribution, is intractable for most interesting spaces of elements. This paper presents a method, palo, that side-steps these problems by using a set of samples to estimate the unknown distribution, and by using a set of transformations to hill-climb to a local optimum. This process is based on a mathematically rigorous form of utility analysis: in particular, it uses statistical techniques to determine whether the result of a proposed transformation will be better than the original system. We also present an efficient way of implementing this learning system in the context of a general class of performance elements, and include empirical evidence that this approach can work effectively. fl Much of this work was performed at the University of Toronto, where it was supported by the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems and by an operating grant from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

"Title: Word Perfect Corp. A TRANSFORMATION FOR IMPLEMENTING EFFICIENT DYNAMIC BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORKS  
Abstract: Most Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have a fixed topology during learning, and often suffer from a number of shortcomings as a result. Variations of ANNs that use dynamic topologies have shown ability to overcome many of these problems. This paper introduces Location-Independent Transformations (LITs) as a general strategy for implementing distributed feedforward networks that use dynamic topologies (dynamic ANNs) efficiently in parallel hardware. A LIT creates a set of location-independent nodes, where each node computes its part of the network output independent of other nodes, using local information. This type of transformation allows efficient sup port for adding and deleting nodes dynamically during learning. In particular, this paper presents an LIT for standard Backpropagation with two layers of weights, and shows how dynamic extensions to Backpropagation can be supported.

The AA2 learning algorithm incorporates the new rule in a distributed fashion in a short, bounded time. During data processing mode, the ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. ",1

Abstract: COINS Technical Report 92-82 December 1992 Abstract Multivariate decision trees overcome a representational limitation of univariate decision trees: univariate decision trees are restricted to splits of the instance space that are orthogonal to the feature's axis. This paper discusses the following issues for constructing multivariate decision trees: representing a multivariate test, including symbolic and numeric features, learning the coefficients of a multivariate test, selecting the features to include in a test, and pruning of multivariate decision trees. We present some new and review some well-known methods for forming multivariate decision trees. The methods are compared across a variety of learning tasks to assess each method's ability to find concise, accurate decision trees. The results demonstrate that some multivariate methods are more effective than others. In addition, the experiments confirm that allowing multivariate tests improves the accuracy of the resulting decision tree over univariate trees. ","Title: Mingers, 1989 J. Mingers.

"Title: The Use of Explicit Goals for Knowledge to Guide Inference and Learning  
Abstract: Combinatorial explosion of inferences has always been a central problem in artificial intelligence. Although the inferences that can be drawn from a reasoner's knowledge and from available inputs is very large (potentially infinite), the inferential resources available to any reasoning system are limited. With limited inferential capacity and very many potential inferences, reasoners must somehow control the process of inference. Not all inferences are equally useful to a given reasoning system. Any reasoning system that has goals (or any form of a utility function) and acts based on its beliefs indirectly assigns utility to its beliefs. Given limits on the process of inference, and variation in the utility of inferences, it is clear that a reasoner ought to draw the inferences that will be most valuable to it. This paper presents an approach to this problem that makes the utility of a (potential) belief an explicit part of the inference process. The method is to generate explicit desires for knowledge. The question of focus of attention is thereby transformed into two related problems: How can explicit desires for knowledge be used to control inference and facilitate resource-constrained goal pursuit in general? and, Where do these desires for knowledge come from? We present a theory of knowledge goals, or desires for knowledge, and their use in the processes of understanding and learning. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel or unusual newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience.

Abstract: We introduce a new fault-tolerant model of algorithmic learning using an equivalence oracle and an incomplete membership oracle, in which the answers to a random subset of the learner's membership queries may be missing. We demonstrate that, with high probability, it is still possible to learn monotone DNF formulas in polynomial time, provided that the fraction of missing answers is bounded by some constant less than one. Even when half the membership queries are expected to yield no information, our algorithm will exactly identify m-term, n-variable monotone DNF formulas with an expected O(mn 2 ) queries. The same task has been shown to require exponential time using equivalence queries alone. We extend the algorithm to handle some one-sided errors, and discuss several other possible error models. It is hoped that this work may lead to a better understanding of the power of membership queries and the effects of faulty teachers on query models of concept learning.

"Title: Efficient Learning of Typical Finite Automata from Random Walks (Extended Abstract)  
Abstract: This paper describes new and efficient algorithms for learning deterministic finite automata. Our approach is primarily distinguished by two features: (1) the adoption of an average-case setting to model the ""typical"" labeling of a finite automaton, while retaining a worst-case model for the underlying graph of the automaton, along with (2) a learning model in which the learner is not provided with the means to experiment with the machine, but rather must learn solely by observing the automaton's output behavior on a random input sequence. The main contribution of this paper is in presenting the first efficient algorithms for learning non-trivial classes of automata in an entirely passive learning model. We adopt an on-line learning model in which the learner is asked to predict the output of the next state, given the next symbol of the random input sequence; the goal of the learner is to make as few prediction mistakes as possible. Assuming the learner has a means of resetting the target machine to a fixed start state, we first present an efficient algorithm that makes an expected polynomial number of mistakes in this model. Next, we show how this first algorithm can be used as a subroutine by a second algorithm that also makes a polynomial number of mistakes even in the absence of a reset. Along the way, we prove a number of combinatorial results for randomly labeled automata. We also show that the labeling of the states and the bits of the input sequence need not be truly random, but merely semi-random. Finally, we discuss an extension of our results to a model in which automata are used to represent distributions over binary strings. ","Title: The Power of Team Exploration: Two Robots Can Learn Unlabeled Directed Graphs  
Abstract: We show that two cooperating robots can learn exactly any strongly-connected directed graph with n indistinguishable nodes in expected time polynomial in n. We introduce a new type of homing sequence for two robots, which helps the robots recognize certain previously-seen nodes. We then present an algorithm in which the robots learn the graph and the homing sequence simultaneously by actively wandering through the graph. Unlike most previous learning results using homing sequences, our algorithm does not require a teacher to provide counterexamples. Furthermore, the algorithm can use efficiently any additional information available that distinguishes nodes. We also present an algorithm in which the robots learn by taking random walks. The rate at which a random walk on a graph converges to the stationary distribution is characterized by the conductance of the graph. Our random-walk algorithm learns in expected time polynomial in n and in the inverse of the conductance and is more efficient than the homing-sequence algorithm for high-conductance graphs. ",1
"Title: In:  A Mixture Model System for Medical and Machine Diagnosis  
Abstract: Diagnosis of human disease or machine fault is a missing data problem since many variables are initially unknown. Additional information needs to be obtained. The joint probability distribution of the data can be used to solve this problem. We model this with mixture models whose parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. This gives the benefit that missing data in the database itself can also be handled correctly. The request for new information to refine the diagnosis is performed using the maximum utility principle. Since the system is based on learning it is domain independent and less labor intensive than expert systems or probabilistic networks. An example using a heart disease database is presented.","Title: Using Temporal-Difference Reinforcement Learning to Improve Decision-Theoretic Utilities for Diagnosis

There are many methods for probability modeling, but few for learning utility and decision models. We use reinforcement learning to find the optimal sequence of questions in a diagnosis situation while maintaining a high accuracy. Automated diagnosis on a heart-disease domain is used to demonstrate that temporal-difference learning can improve diagnosis. On the Cleveland heart-disease database our results are better than those reported from all previous methods. ",1
"Title: Von Mises type statistics for single site updated local interaction random fields  
Abstract: Random field models in image analysis and spatial statistics usually have local interactions. They can be simulated by Markov chains which update a single site at a time. The updating rules typically condition on only a few neighboring sites. If we want to approximate the expectation of a bounded function, can we make better use of the simulations than through the empirical estimator? We describe symmetrizations of the empirical estimator which are computationally feasible and can lead to considerable variance reduction. The method is reminiscent of the idea behind generalized von Mises statistics. To simplify the exposition, we consider mainly nearest neighbor random fields and the Gibbs sampler. ","Title: A simulation approach to convergence rates for Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are very commonly used in Bayesian statistics for sampling from complicated, high-dimensional posterior distributions. A continuing source of uncertainty is how long such a sampler must be run in order to converge approximately to its target stationary distribution. Rosenthal (1995b) presents a method to compute rigorous theoretical upper bounds on the number of iterations required to achieve a specified degree of convergence in total variation distance by verifying drift and minorization conditions. We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in Rosenthal's theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it can not provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof. Acknowledgements.

Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs.

We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.","Title: Cooperation of Data-driven and Model-based Induction Methods for Relational Learning  
Abstract: Inductive learning in relational domains has been shown to be intractable in general. Many approaches to this task have been suggested nevertheless; all in some way restrict the hypothesis space searched. They can be roughly divided into two groups: data-driven, where the restriction is encoded into the algorithm, and model-based, where the restrictions are made more or less explicit with some form of declarative bias. This paper describes Incy, an inductive learner that seeks to combine aspects of both approaches. Incy is initially data-driven, using examples and background knowledge to put forth and specialize hypotheses based on the ""connectivity"" of the data at hand. It is model-driven in that hypotheses are abstracted into rule models, which are used both for control decisions in the data-driven phase and for model-guided induction. Key Words: Inductive learning in relational domains, cooperation of data-driven and model-guided methods, implicit and declarative bias. ",1

"Title: Robust Parameter Learning in Bayesian Networks with Missing Data  
Abstract: There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing ""module"" could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified. ","Title: Operations for Learning with Graphical Models decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide
Abstract: This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. ",1

Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formalism each employs to handle uncertainty may not be uniform. In order to be able to combine these knowledge bases of different formats, we need to first establish a common basis for characterizing and evaluating the different formalisms, and provide a semantics for the combined mechanism. A common framework can provide an infrastructure for building an integrated system, and is essential if we are to understand its behavior. We present a unifying framework based on an ordered partition of possible worlds called partition sequences, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of biasing towards certain possible scenarios when we are uncertain of the actual situation. We show that some of the existing formalisms, namely, default logic, autoepistemic logic, probabilistic conditioning and thresholding (generalized conditioning), and possibility theory can be incorporated into this general framework.","Title: NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO BLIND SEPARATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF IMAGES

","Title: Online Learning with Random Representations  
Abstract: We consider the requirements of online learning|learning which must be done incrementally and in realtime, with the results of learning available soon after each new example is acquired. Despite the abundance of methods for learning from examples, there are few that can be used effectively for online learning, e.g., as components of reinforcement learning systems. Most of these few, including radial basis functions, CMACs, Ko-honen's self-organizing maps, and those developed in this paper, share the same structure. All expand the original input representation into a higher dimensional representation in an unsupervised way, and then map that representation to the final answer using a relatively simple supervised learner, such as a perceptron or LMS rule. Such structures learn very rapidly and reliably, but have been thought either to scale poorly or to require extensive domain knowledge. To the contrary, some researchers (Rosenblatt, 1962; Gallant & Smith, 1987; Kanerva, 1988; Prager & Fallside, 1988) have argued that the expanded representation can be chosen largely at random with good results. The main contribution of this paper is to develop and test this hypothesis. We show that simple random-representation methods can perform as well as nearest-neighbor methods (while being more suited to online learning), and significantly better than backpropagation. We find that the size of the random representation does increase with the dimensionality of the problem, but not unreasonably so, and that the required size can be reduced substantially using unsupervised-learning techniques. Our results suggest that randomness has a useful role to play in online supervised learning and constructive induction. ",1

Abstract: The Bayesian approach to comparing models involves calculating the posterior probability of each plausible model. For high-dimensional contingency tables, the set of plausible models is very large. We focus attention on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (Green, 1995) and develop strategies for calculating posterior probabilities of hierarchical, graphical or decomposable log-linear models. Even for tables of moderate size, these sets of models may be very large. The choice of suitable prior distributions for model parameters is also discussed in detail, and two examples are presented. For the first example, a 2 fi 3 fi 4 table, the model probabilities calculated using our reversible jump approach are compared with model probabilities calculated exactly or by using an alternative approximation. The second example is a 2 6 contingency table for which exact methods are infeasible, due to the large number of possible models.

Abstract: We show how to learn monomials in the presence of malicious noise, when the underlined distribution is a product distribution. We show that our results apply not only to product distributions but to a wide class of distributions. ","Title: Toward Efficient Agnostic Learning  
Abstract: In this paper we initiate an investigation of generalizations of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model that attempt to significantly weaken the target function assumptions. The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables.

"Title: BRAINSTRUCTURED CONNECTIONIST NETWORKS THAT PERCEIVE AND LEARN  
Abstract: This paper specifies the main features of Brain-like, Neuronal, and Connectionist models; argues for the need for, and usefulness of, appropriate successively larger brain-like structures; and examines parallel-hierarchical Recognition Cone models of perception from this perspective, as examples of such structures. The anatomy, physiology, behavior, and development of the visual system are briefly summarized to motivate the architecture of brain-structured networks for perceptual recognition. Results are presented from simulations of carefully pre-designed Recognition Cone structures that perceive objects (e.g., houses) in digitized photographs. A framework for perceptual learning is introduced, including mechanisms for generation-discovery (feedback-guided growth of new links and nodes, subject to brain-like constraints (e.g., local receptive fields, global convergence-divergence). The information processing transforms discovered through generation are fine-tuned by feedback-guided reweight-ing of links. Some preliminary results are presented of brain-structured networks that learn to recognize simple objects (e.g., letters of the alphabet, cups, apples, bananas) through feedback-guided generation and reweighting. These show large improvements over networks that either lack brain-like structure or/and learn by reweighting of links alone. ","Title: Experiments with the Cascade-Correlation Algorithm

"Title: The Automated Mapping of Plans for Plan Recognition  
Abstract: To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models of what the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible or expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition. Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the possible plans the other agents may be following, and develop special techniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supporting inference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, we describe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible procedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic belief networks. ","Title: Introduction to the Special Section on Knowledge-Based Construction of Probabilistic and Decision Models (IEEE Transactions
Abstract: Modeling techniques developed recently in the AI and uncertain reasoning communities permit significantly more flexible specifications of probabilistic knowledge. Specifically, graphical decision-modeling formalisms|belief networks, influence diagrams, and their variants|provide compact representation of probabilistic relationships, and support inference algorithms that automatically exploit the dependence structure in such models [1, 3, 4]. These advances have brought on a resurgence of interest in computational decision systems based on normative theories of belief and preference. However, graphical decision-modeling languages are still quite limited for purposes of knowledge representation because, while they can describe the relationships among particular event instances, they cannot capture general knowledge about probabilistic relationships across classes of events. The inability to capture general knowledge is a serious impediment for those AI tasks in which the relevant factors of a decision problem cannot be enumerated in advance. A graphical decision model encodes a particular set of probabilistic dependencies, a predefined set of decision alternatives, and a specific mathematical form for a utility function. Given a properly specified model, there exist relatively efficient algorithms for calculating posterior probabilities and optimal decision policies. A range of similar cases may be handled by parametric variations of the original model. However, if the structure of dependencies, the set of available alternatives, or the form of utility function changes from situation to situation, then a fixed network representation is no longer adequate. An ideal computational decision system would possess general, broad knowledge of a domain, but would have the ability to reason about the particular circumstances of any given decision problem within the domain. One obvious approach|which we call call knowledge-based model construction (KBMC)|is to generate a decision model dynamically at run-time, based on the problem description and information received thus far. Model construction consists of selection, instantiation, and assembly of causal and associational relationships from a broad knowledge base of general relationships among domain concepts. For example, suppose we wish to develop a system to recommend appropriate actions for maintaining a computer network. The natural graphical decision model would include chance ",1
"Title: Active Learning with Committees for Text Categorization  
Abstract: In many real-world domains like text categorization, supervised learning requires a large number of training examples. In this paper we describe an active learning method that uses a committee of learners to reduce the number of training examples required for learning. Our approach is similar to the Query by Committee framework, where disagreement among the committee members on the predicted label for the input part of the example is used to signal the need for knowing the actual value of the label. Our experiments in text categorization using a committee of Winnow-based learners demonstrate that this approach can reduce the number of labeled training examples required over that used by a single Winnow learner by 1-2 orders of magnitude. This paper is not under review or accepted for publication in another conference or journal. Acknowledgements: The availability of the Reuters-22173 corpus [Reuters] and of the | STAT Data Manipulation and Analysis Programs [Perlman] has greatly assisted in our research to date. ","Title: Query by Committee  
Abstract: We propose an algorithm called query by committee, in which a committee of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms. ",1
"Title: Learning Viewpoint Invariant Face Representations from Visual Experience by Temporal Association  
Abstract: In natural visual experience, different views of an object or face tend to appear in close temporal proximity. A set of simulations is presented which demonstrate how viewpoint invariant representations of faces can be developed from visual experience by capturing the temporal relationships among the input patterns. The simulations explored the interaction of temporal smoothing of activity signals with Hebbian learning (Foldiak, 1991) in both a feed-forward system and a recurrent system. The recurrent system was a generalization of a Hopfield network with a lowpass temporal filter on all unit activities. Following training on sequences of graylevel images of faces as they changed pose, multiple views of a given face fell into the same basin of attraction, and the system acquired representations of faces that were approximately viewpoint invariant. ","Title: Viewpoint invariant face recognition using independent component analysis and attractor networks  
Abstract: We have explored two approaches to recognizing faces across changes in pose. First, we developed a representation of face images based on independent component analysis (ICA) and compared it to a principal component analysis (PCA) representation for face recognition. The ICA basis vectors for this data set were more spatially local than the PCA basis vectors and the ICA representation had greater invariance to changes in pose. Second, we present a model for the development of viewpoint invariant responses to faces from visual experience in a biological system. The temporal continuity of natural visual experience was incorporated into an attractor network model by Hebbian learning following a lowpass temporal filter on unit activities. When combined with the temporal filter, a basic Hebbian update rule became a generalization of Griniasty et al. (1993), which associates temporally proximal input patterns into basins of attraction. The system acquired rep resentations of faces that were largely independent of pose.",1
"Title: Priors and Component Structures in Autoregressive Time Series Models  
Abstract: New approaches to prior specification and structuring in autoregressive time series models are introduced and developed. We focus on defining classes of prior distributions for parameters and latent variables related to latent components of an autoregressive model for an observed time series. These new priors naturally permit the incorporation of both qualitative and quantitative prior information about the number and relative importance of physically meaningful components that represent low frequency trends, quasi-periodic sub-processes, and high frequency residual noise components of observed series. The class of priors also naturally incorporates uncertainty about model order, and hence leads in posterior analysis to model order assessment and resulting posterior and predictive inferences that incorporate full uncertainties about model order as well as model parameters. Analysis also formally incorporates uncertainty, and leads to inferences about, unknown initial values of the time series, as it does for predictions of future values. Posterior analysis involves easily implemented iterative simulation methods, developed and described here. One motivating applied field is climatology, where the evaluation of latent structure, especially quasi-periodic structure, is of critical importance in connection with issues of global climatic variability. We explore analysis of data from the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), one of several series that has been central in recent high-profile debates in the atmospheric sciences about recent apparent trends in climatic indicators. ","Title: Bayesian Inference on Periodicities and Component Spectral Structure in Time Series  
Abstract: Summary We detail and illustrate time series analysis and spectral inference in autoregressive models with a focus on the underlying latent structure and time series decompositions. A novel class of priors on parameters of latent components leads to a new class of smoothness priors on autoregressive coefficients, provides for formal inference on model order, including very high order models, and leads to the incorporation of uncertainty about model order into summary inferences. The class of prior models also allows for subsets of unit roots, and hence leads to inference on sustained though stochastically time-varying periodicities in time series. Applications to analysis of the frequency composition of time series, in both time and spectral domains, is illustrated in a study of a time series from astronomy. This analyses demonstrates the impact and utility of the new class of priors in addressing model order uncertainty and in allowing for unit root structure. Time domain decomposition of a time series into estimated latent components provides an important alternative view of the component spectral characteristics of a series. In addition, our data analysis illustrates the utility of the smoothness prior and allowance for unit root structure in inference about spectral densities. In particular, the framework overcomes supposed problems in spectral estimation with autoregressive models using more traditional model fitting methods. ",1
"Title: Heuristics and Normative Models of Judgment under Uncertainty  
Abstract: Psychological evidence shows that probability theory is not a proper descriptive model of intuitive human judgment. Instead, some heuristics have been proposed as such a descriptive model. This paper argues that probability theory has limi tations even as a normative model. A new normative model of judgment under uncertainty is designed under the assumption that the system's knowledge and resources are insufficient with respect to the questions that the system needs to answer. The proposed heuristics in human reasoning can also be observed in this new model, and can be justified according to the assumption. ","Title: From Inheritance Relation to Non-Axiomatic Logic

"Title: GAL: Networks that grow when they learn and shrink when they forget  
Abstract: Learning when limited to modification of some parameters has a limited scope; the capability to modify the system structure is also needed to get a wider range of the learnable. In the case of artificial neural networks, learning by iterative adjustment of synaptic weights can only succeed if the network designer predefines an appropriate network structure, i.e., number of hidden layers, units, and the size and shape of their receptive and projective fields. This paper advocates the view that the network structure should not, as usually done, be determined by trial-and-error but should be computed by the learning algorithm. Incremental learning algorithms can modify the network structure by addition and/or removal of units and/or links. A survey of current connectionist literature is given on this line of thought. ""Grow and Learn"" (GAL) is a new algorithm that learns an association at one-shot due to being incremental and using a local representation. During the so-called ""sleep"" phase, units that were previously stored but which are no longer necessary due to recent modifications are removed to minimize network complexity. The incrementally constructed network can later be finetuned off-line to improve performance. Another method proposed that greatly increases recognition accuracy is to train a number of networks and vote over their responses. The algorithm and its variants are tested on recognition of handwritten numerals and seem promising especially in terms of learning speed. This makes the algorithm attractive for on-line learning tasks, e.g., in robotics. The biological plausibility of incremental learning is also discussed briefly.

"Title: Scatter-partitioning RBF network for function regression and image  
Abstract: segmentation: Preliminary results Abstract. Scatter-partitioning Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks increase their number of degrees of freedom with the complexity of an input-output mapping to be estimated on the basis of a supervised training data set. Due to its superior expressive power a scatter-partitioning Gaussian RBF (GRBF) model, termed Supervised Growing Neural Gas (SGNG), is selected from the literature. SGNG employs a one-stage error-driven learning strategy and is capable of generating and removing both hidden units and synaptic connections. A slightly modified SGNG version is tested as a function estimator when the training surface to be fitted is an image, i.e., a 2-D signal whose size is finite. The relationship between the generation, by the learning system, of disjointed maps of hidden units and the presence, in the image, of pictorially homogeneous subsets (segments) is investigated. Unfortunately, the examined SGNG version performs poorly both as function estimator and image segmenter. This may be due to an intrinsic inadequacy of the one-stage error-driven learning strategy to adjust structural parameters and output weights simultaneously but consistently. In the framework of RBF networks, further studies should investigate the combination of two-stage error-driven learning strategies with synapse generation and removal criteria. y Internal report of the paper entitled ""Image segmentation with scatter-partitioning RBF networks: A feasibility study,"" to be presented at the conference Applications and Science of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Evolutionary Computation, part of SPIE's International Symposium on Optical Science, Engineering and Instrumentation, 19-24 July 1998, San Diego, CA. ","Title: Growing Cell Structures A Self-organizing Network for Unsupervised and Supervised Learning  
Abstract: We present a new self-organizing neural network model having two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches, e.g., the Kohonen feature map, is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process which also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method which results from the combination of the abovementioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible in contrast to earlier approaches toperform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks which generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented which are better than any results previously published. fl submitted for publication",1

"Title: Tight Performance Bounds on Greedy Policies Based on Imperfect Value Functions  
Abstract: Consider a given value function on states of a Markov decision problem, as might result from applying a reinforcement learning algorithm. Unless this value function equals the corresponding optimal value function, at some states there will be a discrepancy, which is natural to call the Bellman residual, between what the value function specifies at that state and what is obtained by a one-step lookahead along the seemingly best action at that state using the given value function to evaluate all succeeding states. This paper derives a tight bound on how far from optimal the discounted return for a greedy policy based on the given value function will be as a function of the maximum norm magnitude of this Bellman residual. A corresponding result is also obtained for value functions defined on state-action pairs, as are used in Q-learning. One significant application of these results is to problems where a function approximator is used to learn a value function, with training of the approxi-mator based on trying to minimize the Bellman residual across states or state-action pairs. When control is based on the use of the resulting value function, this result provides a link between how well the objectives of function approximator training are met and the quality of the resulting control. ","Title: Integrated Architectures for Learning, Planning, and Reacting Based on Approximating Dynamic Programming  
Abstract: This paper extends previous work with Dyna, a class of architectures for intelligent systems based on approximating dynamic programming methods. Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.",1
"Title: A simulation approach to convergence rates for Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are very commonly used in Bayesian statistics for sampling from complicated, high-dimensional posterior distributions. A continuing source of uncertainty is how long such a sampler must be run in order to converge approximately to its target stationary distribution. Rosenthal (1995b) presents a method to compute rigorous theoretical upper bounds on the number of iterations required to achieve a specified degree of convergence in total variation distance by verifying drift and minorization conditions. We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in Rosenthal's theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it can not provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof. Acknowledgements. We thank Brad Carlin for assistance and encouragement. ","Title: Two convergence properties of hybrid samplers  
Abstract: This note considers positive recurrent Markov chains where the probability of remaining in the current state is arbitrarily close to 1.

The results are motivated by applications for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms which are constructed in terms of a rejection probability, (where a rejection involves remaining at the current state).

Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on solving graph coloring problems with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). After testing different algorithm variants we conclude that the best option is an asexual EA using order-based representation and an adaptation mechanism that periodically changes the fitness function during the evolution. This adaptive EA is general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping GA on a wide range of problem instances with different size, topology and edge density. The results show that the adaptive EA is superior to the Grouping GA and outperforms DSatur on the hardest problem instances. Furthermore, it scales up better with the problem size than the other two algorithms and indicates a linear computational complexity. ","Title: Solving 3-SAT by GAs Adapting Constraint Weights

"Title: Exact Identification of Read-once Formulas Using Fixed Points of Amplification Functions  
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new technique for exactly identifying certain classes of read-once Boolean formulas. The method is based on sampling the input-output behavior of the target formula on a probability distribution that is determined by the fixed point of the formula's amplification function (defined as the probability that a 1 is output by the formula when each input bit is 1 independently with probability p). By performing various statistical tests on easily sampled variants of the fixed-point distribution, we are able to efficiently infer all structural information about any logarithmic-depth formula (with high probability). We apply our results to prove the existence of short universal identification sequences for large classes of formulas. We also describe extensions of our algorithms to handle high rates of noise, and to learn formulas of unbounded depth in Valiant's model with respect to specific distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a new fault-tolerant model of algorithmic learning using an equivalence oracle and an incomplete membership oracle, in which the answers to a random subset of the learner's membership queries may be missing. We demonstrate that, with high probability, it is still possible to learn monotone DNF formulas in polynomial time, provided that the fraction of missing answers is bounded by some constant less than one. Even when half the membership queries are expected to yield no information, our algorithm will exactly identify m-term, n-variable monotone DNF formulas with an expected O(mn 2 ) queries. The same task has been shown to require exponential time using equivalence queries alone. We extend the algorithm to handle some one-sided errors, and discuss several other possible error models. It is hoped that this work may lead to a better understanding of the power of membership queries and the effects of faulty teachers on query models of concept learning. ",1
"Title: ILP with Noise and Fixed Example Size: A Bayesian Approach  
Abstract: Current inductive logic programming systems are limited in their handling of noise, as they employ a greedy covering approach to constructing the hypothesis one clause at a time. This approach also causes difficulty in learning recursive predicates. Additionally, many current systems have an implicit expectation that the cardinality of the positive and negative examples reflect the ""proportion"" of the concept to the instance space. A framework for learning from noisy data and fixed example size is presented. A Bayesian heuristic for finding the most probable hypothesis in this general framework is derived. This approach evaluates a hypothesis as a whole rather than one clause at a time. The heuristic, which has nice theoretical properties, is incorporated in an ILP system, Lime. Experimental results show that Lime handles noise better than FOIL and PROGOL. It is able to learn recursive definitions from noisy data on which other systems do not perform well. Lime is also capable of learning from only positive data and also from only negative data.","Title: Extraction of Meta-Knowledge to Restrict the Hypothesis Space for ILP Systems incorporating them in FOIL.
Abstract: Many ILP systems, such as GOLEM, FOIL, and MIS, take advantage of user supplied meta-knowledge to restrict the hypothesis space. This meta-knowledge can be in the form of type information about arguments in the predicate being learned, or it can be information about whether a certain argument in the predicate is functionally dependent on the other arguments (supplied as mode information). This meta knowledge is explicitly supplied to an ILP system in addition to the data. The present paper argues that in many cases the meta knowledge can be extracted directly from the raw data. Three algorithms are presented that learn type, mode, and symmetric meta-knowledge from data. These algorithms can be incorporated in existing ILP systems in the form of a preprocessor that obviates the need for a user to explicitly provide this information. In many cases, the algorithms can extract meta- knowledge that the user is either unaware of, but which information can be used by the ILP system to restrict the hypothesis space. ",1
"Title: Combining the Predictions of Multiple Classifiers: Using Competitive Learning to Initialize Neural Networks  
Abstract: The primary goal of inductive learning is to generalize well that is, induce a function that accurately produces the correct output for future inputs. Hansen and Salamon showed that, under certain assumptions, combining the predictions of several separately trained neural networks will improve generalization. One of their key assumptions is that the individual networks should be independent in the errors they produce. In the standard way of performing backpropagation this assumption may be violated, because the standard procedure is to initialize network weights in the region of weight space near the origin. This means that backpropagation's gradient-descent search may only reach a small subset of the possible local minima. In this paper we present an approach to initializing neural networks that uses competitive learning to intelligently create networks that are originally located far from the origin of weight space, thereby potentially increasing the set of reachable local minima. We report experiments on two real-world datasets where combinations of networks initialized with our method generalize better than combina tions of networks initialized the traditional way.","Title: Pruning Recurrent Neural Networks for Improved Generalization Performance  
Abstract: Determining the architecture of a neural network is an important issue for any learning task. For recurrent neural networks no general methods exist that permit the estimation of the number of layers of hidden neurons, the size of layers or the number of weights. We present a simple pruning heuristic which significantly improves the generalization performance of trained recurrent networks. We illustrate this heuristic by training a fully recurrent neural network on positive and negative strings of a regular grammar. We also show that if rules are extracted from networks trained to recognize these strings, that rules extracted after pruning are more consistent with the rules to be learned. This performance improvement is obtained by pruning and retraining the networks. Simulations are shown for training and pruning a recurrent neural net on strings generated by two regular grammars, a randomly-generated 10-state grammar and an 8-state triple parity grammar. Further simulations indicate that this pruning method can gives generalization performance superior to that obtained by training with weight decay.",1

Abstract: In real world applications, software engineers recognise the use of memory must be organised via data structures and that software using the data must be independant of the data structures' implementation details. They achieve this by using abstract data structures, such as records, files and buffers. We demonstrate that genetic programming can automatically implement simple abstract data structures, considering in detail the task of evolving a list. We show general and reasonably efficient implementations can be automatically generated from simple primitives. A model for maintaining evolved code is demonstrated using the list problem. Much published work on genetic programming (GP) evolves functions without side-effects to learn patterns in test data. In contrast human written programs often make extensive and explicit use of memory. Indeed memory in some form is required for a programming system to be Turing Complete, i.e. for it to be possible to write any (computable) program in that system. However inclusion of memory can make the interactions between parts of programs much more complex and so make it harder to produce programs. Despite this it has been shown GP can automatically create programs which explicitly use memory [Teller 1994]. In both normal and genetic programming considerable benefits have been found in adopting a structured approach. For example [Koza 1994] shows the introduction of evolvable code modules (automatically defined functions, ADFs) can greatly help GP to reach a solution. We suggest that a corresponding structured approach to use of data will similarly have significant advantage to GP. Earlier work has demonstrated that genetic programming can automatically generate simple abstract data structures, namely stacks and queues [Langdon 1995a]. That is, GP can evolve programs that organise memory (accessed via simple read and write primitives) into data structures which can be used by external software without it needing to know how they are implemented. This chapter shows it is possible to evolve a list data structure from basic primitives. [Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman 1987] suggest three different ways to implement a list but these experiments show GP can evolve its own implementation. This requires all the list components to agree on one implementation as they co-evolve together. Section 20.3 describes the GP architecture, including use of Pareto multiple component fitness scoring (20.3.4) and measures aimed at speeding the GP search (20.3.5). The evolved solutions are described in Section 20.4. Section 20.5 presents a candidate model for maintaining evolved software. This is followed by a discussion of what we have learned (20.6) and conclusions that can be drawn (20.7). ",1
"Title: Program Search with a Hierarchical Variable Length Representation: Genetic Programming, Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing  
Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of Genetic Programming(GP) with Simulated Annealing (SA) and Stochastic Iterated Hill Climbing (SIHC) based on a suite of program discovery problems which have been previously tackled only with GP. All three search algorithms employ the hierarchical variable length representation for programs brought into recent prominence with the GP paradigm [8]. We feel it is not intuitively obvious that mutation-based adaptive search can handle program discovery yet, to date, for each GP problem we have tried, SA or SIHC also work.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: DISCOVERING NEURAL NETS WITH LOW KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY AND HIGH GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY Neural Networks 10(5):857-873, 1997  
Abstract: Many neural net learning algorithms aim at finding ""simple"" nets to explain training data. The expectation is: the ""simpler"" the networks, the better the generalization on test data (! Occam's razor). Previous implementations, however, use measures for ""simplicity"" that lack the power, universality and elegance of those based on Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff's algorithmic probability. Likewise, most previous approaches (especially those of the ""Bayesian"" kind) suffer from the problem of choosing appropriate priors. This paper addresses both issues. It first reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learning, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The universal prior leads to a probabilistic method for finding ""algorithmically simple"" problem solutions with high generalization capability. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. For a given problem, solution candidates are computed by efficient ""self-sizing"" programs that influence their own runtime and storage size. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the ""good"" programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data). Simulations focus on the task of discovering ""algorithmically simple"" neural networks with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability. It is demonstrated that the method, at least with certain toy problems where it is computationally feasible, can lead to generalization results unmatchable by previous neural net algorithms. Much remains do be done, however, to make large scale applications and ""incremental learning"" feasible.","Title: GUESSING CAN OUTPERFORM MANY LONG TIME LAG ALGORITHMS

"Title: Learning from positive data  
Abstract: Gold showed in 1967 that not even regular grammars can be exactly identified from positive examples alone. Since it is known that children learn natural grammars almost exclusively from positives examples, Gold's result has been used as a theoretical support for Chomsky's theory of innate human linguistic abilities. In this paper new results are presented which show that within a Bayesian framework not only grammars, but also logic programs are learnable with arbitrarily low expected error from positive examples only. In addition, we show that the upper bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes' posterior probability when learning from positive examples is within a small additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and negative examples. An Inductive Logic Programming implementation is described which avoids the pitfalls of greedy search by global optimisation of this function during the local construction of individual clauses of the hypothesis. Results of testing this implementation on artificially-generated data-sets are reported. These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions.

"Title: Exponential Convergence of Langevin Diffusions and Their Discrete Approximations  
Abstract: In this paper we consider a continous time method of approximating a given distribution using the Langevin diffusion dL t = dW t + 1 2 r log (L t )dt: We find conditions under which this diffusion converges exponentially quickly to or does not: in one dimension, these are essentially that for distributions with exponential tails of the form (x) / exp(fljxj fi ), 0 &lt; fi &lt; 1, exponential convergence occurs if and only if fi 1. We then consider conditions under which the discrete approximations to the diffusion converge. We first show that even when the diffusion itself converges, naive discretisations need not do so. We then consider a ""Metropolis-adjusted"" version of the algorithm, and find conditions under which this also converges at an exponential rate: perhaps surprisingly, even the Metropolised version need not converge exponentially fast even if the diffusion does. We briefly discuss a truncated form of the algorithm which, in practice, should avoid the difficulties of the other forms. ","Title: Rates of convergence of the Hastings and Metropolis algorithms  
Abstract: We apply recent results in Markov chain theory to Hastings and Metropolis algorithms with either independent or symmetric candidate distributions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithms to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . In the independence case (in IR k ) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of ; in the symmetric case (in IR only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective.

"Title: Analysis of Decision Boundaries Generated by Constructive Neural Network Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: Constructive learning algorithms offer an approach to incremental construction of near-minimal artificial neural networks for pattern classification. Examples of such algorithms include Tower, Pyramid, Upstart, and Tiling algorithms which construct multilayer networks of threshold logic units (or, multilayer perceptrons). These algorithms differ in terms of the topology of the networks that they construct which in turn biases the search for a decision boundary that correctly classifies the training set. This paper presents an analysis of such algorithms from a geometrical perspective. This analysis helps in a better characterization of the search bias employed by the different algorithms in relation to the geometrical distribution of examples in the training set. Simple experiments with non linearly separable training sets support the results of mathematical analysis of such algorithms. This suggests the possibility of designing more efficient constructive algorithms that dynamically choose among different biases to build near-minimal networks for pattern classification. ","Title: Properties of Genetic Representations of Neural Architectures  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms and related evolutionary techniques offer a promising approach for automatically exploring the design space of neural architectures for artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling. Central to this process of evolutionary design of neural architectures (EDNA) is the choice of the representation scheme that is used to encode a neural architecture in the form of a gene string (genotype) and to decode a genotype into the corresponding neural architecture (phenotype). The representation scheme used not only constrains the class of neural architectures that are representable (evolvable) in the system, but also determines the efficiency and the time-space complexity of the evolutionary design procedure as a whole. This paper identifies and discusses a set of properties that can be used to characterize different representations used in EDNA and to design or select representations with the necessary properties for particular classes of applications.",1
"Title: Algorithmic Stability and Sanity-Check Bounds for Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation  
Abstract: In this paper we prove sanity-check bounds for the error of the leave-one-out cross-validation estimate of the generalization error: that is, bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse than that of the training error estimate. The name sanity-check refers to the fact that although we often expect the leave-one-out estimate to perform considerably better than the training error estimate, we are here only seeking assurance that its performance will not be considerably worse. Perhaps surprisingly, such assurance has been given only for rather limited cases in the prior literature on cross-validation. Any nontrivial bound on the error of leave-one-out must rely on some notion of algorithmic stability. Previous bounds relied on the rather strong notion of hypothesis stability, whose application was primarily limited to nearest-neighbor and other local algorithms. Here we introduce the new and weaker notion of error stability, and apply it to obtain sanity-check bounds for leave-one-out for other classes of learning algorithms, including training error minimization procedures and Bayesian algorithms. We also provide lower bounds demonstrating the necessity of error stability for proving bounds on the error of the leave-one-out estimate, and the fact that for training error minimization algorithms, in the worst case such bounds must still depend on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the hypothesis class. ","Title: Toward Efficient Agnostic Learning  
Abstract: In this paper we initiate an investigation of generalizations of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model that attempt to significantly weaken the target function assumptions. The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables.

"Title: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Job-shop Scheduling  
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning methods to learn domain-specific heuristics for job shop scheduling. A repair-based scheduler starts with a critical-path schedule and incrementally repairs constraint violations with the goal of finding a short conflict-free schedule. The temporal difference algorithm T D() is applied to train a neural network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states. This evaluation function is used by a one-step looka-head search procedure to find good solutions to new scheduling problems. We evaluate this approach on synthetic problems and on problems from a NASA space shuttle payload processing task. The evaluation function is trained on problems involving a small number of jobs and then tested on larger problems. The TD sched-uler performs better than the best known existing algorithm for this task|Zweben's iterative repair method based on simulated annealing. The results suggest that reinforcement learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance scheduling systems.","Title: A Neuro-Dynamic Programming Approach to Retailer Inventory Management 1

"Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key
Abstract: A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical dependency among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm is verified by computer simulations. ","Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds

"Title: Boosting a weak learning algorithm by majority To be published in Information and Computation  
Abstract: We present an algorithm for improving the accuracy of algorithms for learning binary concepts. The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire in his paper ""The strength of weak learnability"", and represents an improvement over his results. The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant's polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances.

We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regres sion are both efficient and accurate.",1
"Title: An Introspection Approach to Querying a Trainer  
Abstract: Technical Report 96-13 January 22, 1996 Abstract This paper introduces the Introspection Approach, a method by which a learning agent employing reinforcement learning can decide when to ask a training agent for instruction. When using our approach, we find that the same number of trainer's responses produced significantly faster learners than by having the learner ask for aid randomly. Guidance received via our approach is more informative than random guidance. Thus, we can reduce the interaction that the training agent has with the learning agent without reducing the speed with which the learner develops its policy. In fact, by being intelligent about when the learner asks for help, we can even increase the learning speed for the same level of trainer interaction. ","Title: Learning from an Automated Training Agent  
Abstract: A learning agent employing reinforcement learning is hindered because it only receives the critic's sparse and weakly informative training information. We present an approach in which an automated training agent may also provide occasional instruction to the learner in the form of actions for the learner to perform. The learner has access to both the critic's feedback and the trainer's instruction. In the experiments, we vary the level of the trainer's interaction with the learner, from allowing the trainer to instruct the learner at almost every time step, to not allowing the trainer to respond at all. We also vary a parameter that controls how the learner incorporates the trainer's actions. The results show significant reductions in the average number of training trials necessary to learn to perform the task.",1
"Title: Searching for dependencies in Bayesian classifiers j A n V n j If the attributes
Abstract: Naive Bayesian classifiers which make independence assumptions perform remarkably well on some data sets but poorly on others. We explore ways to improve the Bayesian classifier by searching for dependencies among attributes. We propose and evaluate two algorithms for detecting dependencies among attributes and show that the backward sequential elimination and joining algorithm provides the most improvement over the naive Bayesian classifier. The domains on which the most improvement occurs are those domains on which the naive Bayesian classifier is significantly less accurate than a decision tree learner. This suggests that the attributes used in some common databases are not independent conditioned on the class and that the violations of the independence assumption that affect the accuracy of the classifier The Bayesian classifier (Duda & Hart, 1973) is a probabilistic method for classification. It can be used to determine the probability that an example j belongs to class C i given values of attributes of an example represented as a set of n nominally-valued attribute-value pairs of the form A 1 = V 1 j : ^ P (A k = V k j jC i ) may be estimated from the training data. To determine the most likely class of a test example, the probability of each class is computed with Equation 1. A classifier created in this manner is sometimes called a simple (Langley, 1993) or naive (Kononenko, 1990) Bayesian classifier. One important evaluation metric for machine learning methods is the predictive accuracy on unseen examples. This is measured by randomly selecting a subset of the examples in a database to use as training examples and reserving the remainder to be used as test examples. In the case of the simple Bayesian classifier, the training examples are used to estimate probabilities and Equation 1.1 is then used can be detected from training data.","Title: Induction of Selective Bayesian Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine previous work on the naive Bayesian classifier and review its limitations, which include a sensitivity to correlated features. We respond to this problem by embedding the naive Bayesian induction scheme within an algorithm that carries out a greedy search through the space of features. We hypothesize that this approach will improve asymptotic accuracy in domains that involve correlated features without reducing the rate of learning in ones that do not. We report experimental results on six natural domains, including comparisons with decision-tree induction, that support these hypotheses. In closing, we discuss other approaches to extending naive Bayesian classifiers and outline some directions for future research. ",1
"Title: Misclassification Minimization  
Abstract: The problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane, attempting to separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls in n-dimensional real space, is formulated as a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). This general LPEC can be converted to an exact penalty problem with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ""counts"" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.","Title: PATTERN RECOGNITION VIA LINEAR PROGRAMMING THEORY AND APPLICATION TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS

"Title: MULTISTRATEGY LEARNING IN REACTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC NAVIGATION  
Abstract: This paper presents a self-improving reactive control system for autonomous robotic navigation. The navigation module uses a schema-based reactive control system to perform the navigation task. The learning module combines case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to continuously tune the navigation system through experience. The case-based reasoning component perceives and characterizes the system's environment, retrieves an appropriate case, and uses the recommendations of the case to tune the parameters of the reactive control system. The reinforcement learning component refines the content of the cases based on the current experience. Together, the learning components perform on-line adaptation, resulting in improved performance as the reactive control system tunes itself to the environment, as well as on-line case learning, resulting in an improved library of cases that capture environmental regularities necessary to perform on-line adaptation. The system is extensively evaluated through simulation studies using several performance metrics and system configurations.","Title: Systematic Evaluation of Design Decisions in CBR Systems  
Abstract: Two important goals in the evaluation of an AI theory or model are to assess the merit of the design decisions in the performance of an implemented computer system and to analyze the impact in the performance when the system faces problem domains with different characteristics. This is particularly difficult in case-based reasoning systems because such systems are typically very complex, as are the tasks and domains in which they operate. We present a methodology for the evaluation of case-based reasoning systems through systematic empirical experimentation over a range of system configurations and environmental conditions, coupled with rigorous statistical analysis of the results of the experiments. This methodology enables us to understand the behavior of the system in terms of the theory and design of the computational model, to select the best system configuration for a given domain, and to predict how the system will behave in response to changing domain and problem characteristics. A case study of a mul-tistrategy case-based and reinforcement learning system which performs autonomous robotic navigation is presented as an example. ",1
"Title: Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications  
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration.","Title: Convergence properties of perturbed Markov chains

","Title: Learning Trees and Rules with Set-valued Features  
Abstract: In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length ""feature vectors"", the components of which are either real numbers or nominal values. We propose an extension of the feature-vector representation that allows the value of a feature to be a set of strings; for instance, to represent a small white and black dog with the nominal features size and species and the set-valued feature color, one might use a feature vector with size=small, species=canis-familiaris and color=fwhite,blackg. Since we make no assumptions about the number of possible set elements, this extension of the traditional feature-vector representation is closely connected to Blum's ""infinite attribute"" representation. We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to set-valued features. We also show by example that many real-world learning problems can be efficiently and naturally represented with set-valued features; in particular, text categorization problems and problems that arise in propositionalizing first-order representations lend themselves to set-valued features.

"Title: Learning sorting and decision trees with POMDPs  
Abstract: pomdps are general models of sequential decisions in which both actions and observations can be probabilistic. Many problems of interest can be formulated as pomdps, yet the use of pomdps has been limited by the lack of effective algorithms. Recently this has started to change and a number of problems such as robot navigation and planning are beginning to be formulated and solved as pomdps. The advantage of the pomdp approach is its clean semantics and its ability to produce principled solutions that integrate physical and information gathering actions. In this paper we pursue this approach in the context of two learning tasks: learning to sort a vector of numbers and learning decision trees from data. Both problems are formulated as pomdps and solved by a general pomdp algorithm. The main lessons and results are that 1) the use of suitable heuristics and representations allows for the solution of sorting and classification pomdps of non-trivial sizes, 2) the quality of the resulting solutions are competitive with the best algorithms, and 3) problematic aspects in decision tree learning such as test and mis-classification costs, noisy tests, and missing values are naturally accommodated.","Title: Learning policies for partially observable environments: Scaling up  
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (pomdp's) model decision problems in which an agent tries to maximize its reward in the face of limited and/or noisy sensor feedback. While the study of pomdp's is motivated by a need to address realistic problems, existing techniques for finding optimal behavior do not appear to scale well and have been unable to find satisfactory policies for problems with more than a dozen states. After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding near-optimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains.",1
"Title: A Survey of Evolution Strategies  
Abstract:  ","Title: Evolution of Non-Deterministic Incremental Algorithms as a New Approach for Search in State Spaces  
Abstract: Let us call a non-deterministic incremental algorithm one that is able to construct any solution to a combinatorial problem by selecting incrementally an ordered sequence of choices that defines this solution, each choice being made non-deterministically. In that case, the state space can be represented as a tree, and a solution is a path from the root of that tree to a leaf. This paper describes how the simulated evolution of a population of such non-deterministic incremental algorithms offers a new approach for the exploration of a state space, compared to other techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Strategies (ES) or Hill Climbing. In particular, the efficiency of this method, implemented as the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model, is presented for the sorting network problem, a reference problem that has challenged computer science. Then, we shall show that the END model remedies some drawbacks of these optimization techniques and even outperforms them for this problem. Indeed, some 16-input sorting networks as good as the best known have been built from scratch, and even a 25-year-old result for the 13-input problem has been improved by one comparator.",1
"Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This paper is a scientific comparison of two code generation techniques with identical goals generation of the best possible software pipelined code for computers with instruction level parallelism. Both are variants of modulo scheduling, a framework for generation of software pipelines pioneered by Rau and Glaser [RaGl81], but are otherwise quite dissimilar. One technique was developed at Silicon Graphics and is used in the MIPSpro compiler. This is the production compiler for SGI s systems which are based on the MIPS R8000 processor [Hsu94]. It is essentially a branchandbound enumeration of possible schedules with extensive pruning. This method is heuristic because of the way it prunes and also because of the interaction between register allocation and scheduling. 1 The second technique aims to produce optimal results by formulating the scheduling and register allocation problem as an integrated integer linear programming (ILP 1 ) problem. This idea has received much recent exposure in the literature [AlGoGa95, Feautrier94, GoAlGa94a, GoAlGa94b, Eichenberger95], but to our knowledge all previous implementations have been too preliminary for detailed measurement and evaluation. In particular, we believe this to be the first published measurement of runtime performance for ILP based generation of software pipelines. A particularly valuable result of this study was evaluation of the heuristic pipelining technology in the SGI compiler . One of the motivations behind the McGill research was the hope that optimal software pipelining, while not in itself practical for use in production compilers, would be useful for their evaluation and validation. Our comparison has indeed provided a quantitative validation of the SGI compilers pipeliner, leading us to increased confidence in both techniques.

Abstract: Recently, software pipelining methods based on an ILP (Integer Linear Programming) framework have been successfully applied to derive rate-optimal schedules for architectures involving clean pipelines | pipelines without structural hazards. The problem for architectures beyond such clean pipelines remains open. One challenge is how, under a unified ILP framework, to simultaneously represent resource constraints for unclean pipelines, and the assignment or mapping of operations from a loop to those pipelines. In this paper we provide a framework which does exactly this, and in addition constructs rate-optimal software pipelined schedules. ",1
"Title: Efficient Learning of Selective Bayesian Network Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computation-ally efficient method for inducing selective Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach is to use information-theoretic metrics to efficiently select a subset of attributes from which to learn the classifier. We explore three conditional, information-theoretic met-rics that are extensions of metrics used extensively in decision tree learning, namely Quin-lan's gain and gain ratio metrics and Man-taras's distance metric. We experimentally show that the algorithms based on gain ratio and distance metric learn selective Bayesian networks that have predictive accuracies as good as or better than those learned by existing selective Bayesian network induction approaches (K2-AS), but at a significantly lower computational cost. We prove that the subset-selection phase of these information-based algorithms has polynomial complexity, as compared to the worst-case exponential time complexity of the corresponding phase in K2-AS.","Title: Toward Optimal Feature Selection  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a method for feature subset selection based on Information Theory. Initially, a framework for defining the theoretically optimal, but computation-ally intractable, method for feature subset selection is presented. We show that our goal should be to eliminate a feature if it gives us little or no additional information beyond that subsumed by the remaining features. In particular, this will be the case for both irrelevant and redundant features. We then give an efficient algorithm for feature selection which computes an approximation to the optimal feature selection criterion. The conditions under which the approximate algorithm is successful are examined. Empirical results are given on a number of data sets, showing that the algorithm effectively han dles datasets with large numbers of features.",1

Abstract: We present new algorithms for reinforcement learning and prove that they have polynomial bounds on the resources required to achieve near-optimal return in general Markov decision processes. After observing that the number of actions required to approach the optimal return is lower bounded by the mixing time T of the optimal policy (in the undiscounted case) or by the horizon time T (in the discounted case), we then give algorithms requiring a number of actions and total computation time that are only polynomial in T and the number of states, for both the undiscounted and discounted cases. An interesting aspect of our algorithms is their explicit handling of the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off. These are the first results in the reinforcement learning literature giving algorithms that provably converge to near-optimal performance in polynomial time for general Markov decision processes. ",1
"Title: Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features  
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant features. We review previous work on attribute selection and present a new algorithm, Oblivion, that carries out greedy pruning of oblivious decision trees, which effectively store a set of abstract cases in memory. We hypothesize that this approach will efficiently identify relevant features even when they interact, as in parity concepts. We report experimental results on artificial domains that support this hypothesis, and experiments with natural domains that show improvement in some cases but not others. In closing, we discuss the implications of our experiments, consider additional work on irrelevant features, and outline some directions for future research.

Abstract: Based on our analysis and experiments using real-world datasets, we find that the greediness of forward feature selection algorithms does not severely corrupt the accuracy of function approximation using the selected input features, but improves the efficiency significantly. Hence, we propose three greedier algorithms in order to further enhance the efficiency of the feature selection processing. We provide empirical results for linear regression, locally weighted regression and k-nearest-neighbor models. We also propose to use these algorithms to develop an offline Chinese and Japanese handwriting recognition system with auto matically configured, local models. ",1
"Title: Learning Continuous Attractors in Recurrent Networks  
Abstract: One approach to invariant object recognition employs a recurrent neural network as an associative memory. In the standard depiction of the network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics. I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task of filling in missing information, the network develops a continuous attractor that models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical viewpoint, the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised A classic approach to invariant object recognition is to use a recurrent neural network as an associative memory[1]. In spite of the intuitive appeal and biological plausibility of this approach, it has largely been abandoned in practical applications. This paper introduces two new concepts that could help resurrect it: object representation by continuous attractors, and learning attractors by pattern completion. In most models of associative memory, memories are stored as attractive fixed points at discrete locations in state space[1]. Discrete attractors may not be appropriate for patterns with continuous variability, like the images of a three-dimensional object from different viewpoints. When the instantiations of an object lie on a continuous pattern manifold, it is more appropriate to represent objects by attractive manifolds of fixed points, or continuous attractors. To make this idea practical, it is important to find methods for learning attractors from examples. A naive method is to train the network to retain examples in short-term memory. This method is deficient because it does not prevent the network from storing spurious fixed points that are unrelated to the examples. A superior method is to train the network to restore examples that have been corrupted, so that it learns to complete patterns by filling in missing information. learning in terms of regression rather than density estimation.","Title: Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: A theory  
Abstract: The head-direction (HD) cells found in the limbic system in freely moving rats represent the instantaneous head direction of the animal in the horizontal plane regardless of the location of the animal. The internal direction represented by these cells uses both self-motion information for inertially based updating and familiar visual landmarks for calibration. Here, a model of the dynamics of the HD cell ensemble is presented. The stability of a localized static activity profile in the network and a dynamic shift mechanism are explained naturally by synaptic weight distribution components with even and odd symmetry, respectively. Under symmetric weights or symmetric reciprocal connections, a stable activity profile close to the known directional tuning curves will emerge. By adding a slight asymmetry to the weights, the activity profile will shift continuously without disturbances to its shape, and the shift speed can be accurately controlled by the strength of the odd-weight component. The generic formulation of the shift mechanism is determined uniquely within the current theoretical framework. The attractor dynamics of the system ensures modality-independence of the internal representation and facilitates the correction for cumulative error by the putative local-view detectors. The model offers a specific one-dimensional example of a computational mechanism in which a truly world-centered representation can be derived from observer-centered sensory inputs by integrating self-motion information.

Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. These algorithms use graph-theoretic techniques to analyze and exploit network topology.

"Title: Some Training Subset Selection Methods for Supervised Learning in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: When using the Genetic Programming (GP) Algorithm on a difficult problem with a large set of training cases, a large population size is needed and a very large number of function-tree evaluations must be carried out. This paper describes how to reduce the number of such evaluations by selecting a small subset of the training data set on which to actually carry out the GP algorithm. Three subset selection methods described in the paper are: Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS), using the current GP run to select `difficult' and/or disused cases, Historical Subset Selection (HSS), using previous GP runs, Random Subset Selection (RSS). GP, GP+DSS, GP+HSS, GP+RSS are compared on a large classification problem. GP+DSS can produce better results in less than 20% of the time taken by GP. GP+HSS can nearly match the results of GP, and, perhaps surprisingly, GP+RSS can occasionally approach the results of GP. GP and GP+DSS are then compared on a smaller problem, and a hybrid Dynamic Fitness Function (DFF), based on DSS, is proposed.","Title: Small Populations over Many Generations can beat Large Populations over Few Generations in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper looks at the use of small populations in Genetic Programming (GP), where the trend in the literature appears to be towards using as large a population as possible, which requires more memory resources and CPU-usage is less efficient. Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS) and Limited Error Fitness (LEF) are two different, adaptive variations of the standard supervised learning method used in GP. This paper compares the performance of GP, GP+DSS, and GP+LEF, on a 958 case classification problem, using a small population size of 50. A similar comparison between GP and GP+DSS is done on a larger and messier 3772 case classification problem. For both problems, GP+DSS with the small population size consistently produces a better answer using fewer tree evaluations than other runs using much larger populations. Even standard GP can be seen to perform well with the much smaller population size, indicating that it is certainly worth an exploratory run or three with a small population size before assuming that a large population size is necessary. It is an interesting notion that smaller can mean faster and better. ",1
"Title: Machine Learning Bias, Statistical Bias, and Statistical Variance of Decision Tree Algorithms  
Abstract: The term ""bias"" is widely used|and with different meanings|in the fields of machine learning and statistics. This paper clarifies the uses of this term and shows how to measure and visualize the statistical bias and variance of learning algorithms. Statistical bias and variance can be applied to diagnose problems with machine learning bias, and the paper shows four examples of this. Finally, the paper discusses methods of reducing bias and variance. Methods based on voting can reduce variance, and the paper compares Breiman's bagging method and our own tree randomization method for voting decision trees. Both methods uniformly improve performance on data sets from the Irvine repository. Tree randomization yields perfect performance on the Letter Recognition task. A weighted nearest neighbor algorithm based on the infinite bootstrap is also introduced. In general, decision tree algorithms have moderate-to-high variance, so an important implication of this work is that variance|rather than appropriate or inappropriate machine learning bias|is an important cause of poor performance for decision tree algorithms. ","Title: Bias Plus Variance Decomposition for Zero-One Loss Functions  
Abstract: We present a bias-variance decomposition of expected misclassification rate, the most commonly used loss function in supervised classification learning. The bias-variance decomposition for quadratic loss functions is well known and serves as an important tool for analyzing learning algorithms, yet no decomposition was offered for the more commonly used zero-one (misclassification) loss functions until the recent work of Kong & Dietterich (1995) and Breiman (1996). Their decomposition suffers from some major shortcomings though (e.g., potentially negative variance), which our decomposition avoids. We show that, in practice, the naive frequency-based estimation of the decomposition terms is by itself biased and show how to correct for this bias. We illustrate the decomposition on various algorithms and datasets from the UCI repository.",1
"Title: Improving the Accuracy and Speed of Support Vector Machines  
Abstract: Support Vector Learning Machines (SVM) are finding application in pattern recognition, regression estimation, and operator inversion for ill-posed problems. Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the ""virtual support vector"" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the ""reduced set"" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1% error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances. The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine. ","Title: Comparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers  
Abstract: The Support Vector (SV) machine is a novel type of learning machine, based on statistical learning theory, which contains polynomial classifiers, neural networks, and radial basis function (RBF) networks as special cases. In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights and threshold such as to minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by k-means clustering and the weights are found using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the US postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest test accuracy, followed by the hybrid approach. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded, but also superior in a practical application.

"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

Abstract: Technical Report No. 9702, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. Gaussian processes are a natural way of defining prior distributions over functions of one or more input variables. In a simple nonparametric regression problem, where such a function gives the mean of a Gaussian distribution for an observed response, a Gaussian process model can easily be implemented using matrix computations that are feasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases. Hyperparameters that define the covariance function of the Gaussian process can be sampled using Markov chain methods. Regression models where the noise has a t distribution and logistic or probit models for classification applications can be implemented by sampling as well for latent values underlying the observations. Software is now available that implements these methods using covariance functions with hierarchical parameterizations. Models defined in this way can discover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs are relevant to predicting the response.

Lawrence Erlbaum (1998). Abstract Gaussian processes provide natural non-parametric prior distributions over regression functions. In this paper we consider regression problems where there is noise on the output, and the variance of the noise depends on the inputs. If we assume that the noise is a smooth function of the inputs, then it is natural to model the noise variance using a second Gaussian process, in addition to the Gaussian process governing the noise-free output value. We show that prior uncertainty about the parameters controlling both processes can be handled and that the posterior distribution of the noise rate can be sampled from using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our results on a synthetic data set give a posterior noise variance that well-approximates the true variance.",1
"Title: In  Unsmearing Visual Motion: Development of Long-Range Horizontal Intrinsic Connections  
Abstract: Human vision systems integrate information nonlocally, across long spatial ranges. For example, a moving stimulus appears smeared when viewed briefly (30 ms), yet sharp when viewed for a longer exposure (100 ms) (Burr, 1980). This suggests that visual systems combine information along a trajectory that matches the motion of the stimulus. Our self-organizing neural network model shows how developmental exposure to moving stimuli can direct the formation of horizontal trajectory-specific motion integration pathways that unsmear representations of moving stimuli. These results account for Burr's data and can potentially also model other phenomena, such as visual inertia.","Title: A Theory of Visual Relative Motion Perception: Grouping, Binding, and Gestalt Organization  
Abstract: The human visual system is more sensitive to the relative motion of objects than to their absolute motion. An understanding of motion perception requires an understanding of how neural circuits can group moving visual elements relative to one another, based upon hierarchical reference frames. We have modeled visual relative motion perception using a neural network architecture that groups visual elements according to Gestalt common-fate principles and exploits information about the behavior of each group to predict the behavior of individual elements. A simple competitive neural circuit binds visual elements together into a representation of a visual object. Information about the spiking pattern of neurons allows transfer of the bindings of an object representation from location to location in the neural circuit as the object moves. The model exhibits characteristics of human object grouping and solves some key neural circuit design problems in visual relative motion perception. ",1

Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.",1

Abstract: Efficient algorithms have been developed for estimating model parameters from measured data, even in the presence of gross errors. In addition to point estimates of parameters, however, assessments of uncertainty are needed. Linear approximations provide standard errors, but these can be misleading when applied to models that are substantially nonlinear. To overcome this difficulty, ""profiling"" methods have been developed for the case in which the regressor variables are error free. In this paper we extend profiling methods to Error-in-Variable-Measurement (EVM) models. We use Laplace's method to integrate out the incidental parameters associated with the measurement errors, and then apply profiling methods to obtain approximate confidence contours for the parameters. This approach is computationally efficient, requiring few function evaluations, and can be applied to large scale problems. It is useful when the certain measurement errors (e.g., input variables) are relatively small, but not so small that they can be ignored. ",1

Abstract: Given a set of samples of an unknown probability distribution, we study the problem of constructing a good approximative Bayesian network model of the probability distribution in question.

In this work, we do not make an attempt to learn arbitrarily complex multi-connected Bayesian network structures, since such resulting models can be unsuitable for practical purposes due to the exponential amount of time required for the reasoning task. Instead, we restrict ourselves to a special class of simple tree-structured Bayesian networks called Bayesian prototype trees, for which a polynomial time algorithm for Bayesian reasoning exists. We show how the probability of a given Bayesian prototype tree model can be evaluated, given the data, and how this evaluation criterion can be used in a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm for searching the model space. The simulated annealing algorithm provably finds the maximal probability model, provided that a sufficient amount of time is used. ",1
"Title: Machine Learning Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences Keywords: Incremental learning, prediction,
Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) approaches can be formulated from the theory of Markov decision processes and the associated method of dynamic programming (DP). The value of this theoretical understanding, however, is tempered by many practical concerns. One important question is whether DP-based approaches that use function approximation rather than lookup tables, can avoid catastrophic effects on performance. This note presents a result in Bertsekas (1987) which guarantees that small errors in the approximation of a task's optimal value function cannot produce arbitrarily bad performance when actions are selected greedily. We derive an upper bound on performance loss which is slightly tighter than that in Bertsekas (1987), and we show the extension of the bound to Q-learning (Watkins, 1989). These results provide a theoretical justification for a practice that is common in reinforcement learning. ",1

The purpose of this more general technique is to find smaller but equally accurate decision trees than those created by other methods. We have tested our algorithm on both real and simulated data, and found that in some cases it produces surprisingly small trees without losing predictive accuracy.

Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity. ",1

Abstract: In this paper we initiate an investigation of generalizations of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model that attempt to significantly weaken the target function assumptions. The ultimate goal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, in which we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. The name derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms, we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the target function) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number of positive and negative results that provide an initial outline of the possibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardness results for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to an agnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning method based on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functions for agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem that involves hidden variables.

Abstract: We build up the mathematical connection between the ""Expectation-Maximization"" (EM) algorithm and gradient-based approaches for maximum likelihood learning of finite Gaussian mixtures. We show that the EM step in parameter space is obtained from the gradient via a projection matrix P , and we provide an explicit expression for the matrix. We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface. Based on these mathematical results, we present a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of EM and other algorithms for the learning of Gaussian mixture models.

Abstract: We present a tree-structured architecture for supervised learning. The statistical model underlying the architecture is a hierarchical mixture model in which both the mixture coefficients and the mixture components are generalized linear models (GLIM's). Learning is treated as a maximum likelihood problem; in particular, we present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for adjusting the parameters of the architecture. We also develop an on-line learning algorithm in which the parameters are updated incrementally. Comparative simulation results are presented in the robot dynamics domain.

"Title: A Cooperative Coevolutionary Approach to Function Optimization  
Abstract: A general model for the coevolution of cooperating species is presented. This model is instantiated and tested in the domain of function optimization, and compared with a traditional GA-based function optimizer. The results are encouraging in two respects. They suggest ways in which the performance of GA and other EA-based optimizers can be improved, and they suggest a new approach to evolving complex structures such as neural networks and rule sets.","Title: Constructing Nominal Xof-N Attributes  
Abstract: Co-evolution of Pursuit and Evasion II: Simulation Methods and Results fl Abstract In a previous SAB paper [10], we presented the scientific rationale for simulating the coevolution of pursuit and evasion strategies. Here, we present an overview of our simulation methods and some results. Our most notable results are as follows. First, co-evolution works to produce good pursuers and good evaders through a pure bootstrapping process, but both types are rather specially adapted to their opponents' current counter-strategies. Second, eyes and brains can also co-evolve within each simulated species for example, pursuers usually evolved eyes on the front of their bodies (like cheetahs), while evaders usually evolved eyes pointing sideways or even backwards (like gazelles). Third, both kinds of coevolution are promoted by allowing spatially distributed populations, gene duplication, and an explicitly spatial morphogenesis program for eyes and brains that allows bilateral symmetry. The paper concludes by discussing some possible applications of simulated pursuit-evasion coevolu tion in biology and entertainment.",1
"Title: In  Improving Elevator Performance Using Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most RL research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.","Title: Self-Improving Factory Simulation using Continuous-time Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: Many factory optimization problems, from inventory control to scheduling and reliability, can be formulated as continuous-time Markov decision processes. A primary goal in such problems is to find a gain-optimal policy that minimizes the long-run average cost. This paper describes a new average-reward algorithm called SMART for finding gain-optimal policies in continuous time semi-Markov decision processes. The paper presents a detailed experimental study of SMART on a large unreliable production inventory problem. SMART outperforms two well-known reliability heuristics from industrial engineering. A key feature of this study is the integration of the reinforcement learning algorithm directly into two commercial discrete-event simulation packages, ARENA and CSIM, paving the way for this approach to be applied to many other factory optimization problems for which there already exist simulation models.",1
"Title: Stochastic Complexity Based Estimation of Missing Elements in Questionnaire Data  
Abstract: In this paper we study a new information-theoretically justified approach to missing data estimation for multivariate categorical data. The approach discussed is a model-based imputation procedure relative to a model class (i.e., a functional form for the probability distribution of the complete data matrix), which in our case is the set of multinomial models with some independence assumptions. Based on the given model class assumption an information-theoretic criterion can be derived to select between the different complete data matrices. Intuitively this general criterion, called stochastic complexity, represents the shortest code length needed for coding the complete data matrix relative to the model class chosen. Using this information-theoretic criteria, the missing data problem is reduced to a search problem, i.e., finding the data completion with minimal stochastic complexity. In the experimental part of the paper we present empirical results of the approach using two real data sets, and compare these results to those achived by commonly used techniques such as case deletion and imputating sample averages. ","Title: Bayesian and Information-Theoretic Priors for Bayesian Network Parameters  
Abstract: We consider Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches for determining non-informative prior distributions in a parametric model family. The information-theoretic approaches are based on the recently modified definition of stochastic complexity by Rissanen, and on the Minimum Message Length (MML) approach by Wallace. The Bayesian alternatives include the uniform prior, and the equivalent sample size priors. In order to be able to empirically compare the different approaches in practice, the methods are instantiated for a model family of practical importance, the family of Bayesian networks.",1
"Title: Cholinergic suppression of transmission may allow combined associative memory function and self-organization in the neocortex.  
Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.","Title: Separating hippocampal maps  Spatial Functions of the Hippocampal Formation and the  
Abstract: The place fields of hippocampal cells in old animals sometimes change when an animal is removed from and then returned to an environment [ Barnes et al., 1997 ] . The ensemble correlation between two sequential visits to the same environment shows a strong bimodality for old animals (near 0, indicative of remapping, and greater than 0.7, indicative of a similar representation between experiences), but a strong unimodality for young animals (greater than 0.7, indicative of a similar representation between experiences). One explanation for this is the multi-map hypothesis in which multiple maps are encoded in the hippocampus: old animals may sometimes be returning to the wrong map. A theory proposed by Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997) suggests that the Barnes et al. experiment implies that the maps are pre-wired in the CA3 region of hippocampus. Here, we offer an alternative explanation in which orthogonalization properties in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of hippocampus interact with errors in self-localization (reset of the path integrator on re-entry into the environment) to produce the bimodality.

"Title: Boosting the Margin: A New Explanation for the Effectiveness of Voting Methods  
Abstract: One of the surprising recurring phenomena observed in experiments with boosting is that the test error of the generated classifier usually does not increase as its size becomes very large, and often is observed to decrease even after the training error reaches zero. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition. ","Title: An Efficient Boosting Algorithm for Combining Preferences  
Abstract: The problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as combining the results of different search engines. This work describes an efficient algorithm for combining multiple preferences. We first give a formal framework for the problem. We then describe and analyze a new boosting algorithm for combining preferences called RankBoost. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a restricted case. We discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different WWW search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. For this task, we compare the performance of RankBoost to the individual search strategies. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations. Here, we present results comparing RankBoost to nearest-neighbor and regression algorithms. ",1
"Title: A Unified Analysis of Value-Function-Based Reinforcement-Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness of the theorem lies in how it allows the asynchronous convergence of a complex reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proven by verifying that a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application of the theorem by analyzing the convergence of Q-learning, model-based reinforcement learning, Q-learning with multi-state updates, Q-learning for Markov games, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. ","Title: Generalized Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic-programming and Reinforcement-learning Algorithms  
Abstract: The problem of maximizing the expected total discounted reward in a completely observable Markovian environment, i.e., a Markov decision process (mdp), models a particular class of sequential decision problems. Algorithms have been developed for making optimal decisions in mdps given either an mdp specification or the opportunity to interact with the mdp over time. Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling. Central to the results are the contraction property of the value operator and a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence. ",1
"Title: A Functional Theory of Creative Reading  
Abstract: Reading is an area of human cognition which has been studied for decades by psychologists, education researchers, and artificial intelligence researchers. Yet, there still does not exist a theory which accurately describes the complete process. We believe that these past attempts fell short due to an incomplete understanding of the overall task of reading; namely, the complete set of mental tasks a reasoner must perform to read and the mechanisms that carry out these tasks. We present a functional theory of the reading process and argue that it represents a coverage of the task. The theory combines experimental results from psychology, artificial intelligence, education, and linguistics, along with the insights we have gained from our own research. This greater understanding of the mental tasks necessary for reading will enable new natural language understanding systems to be more flexible and more capable than earlier ones. Furthermore, we argue that creativity is a necessary component of the reading process and must be considered in any theory or system attempting to describe it. We present a functional theory of creative reading and a novel knowledge organization scheme that supports the creativity mechanisms. The reading theory is currently being implemented in the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Creativity) system, a computer system which reads science fiction stories. fl This paper is part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing, Technical Report series. ","Title: The Use of Explicit Goals for Knowledge to Guide Inference and Learning  
Abstract: Combinatorial explosion of inferences has always been a central problem in artificial intelligence. Although the inferences that can be drawn from a reasoner's knowledge and from available inputs is very large (potentially infinite), the inferential resources available to any reasoning system are limited. With limited inferential capacity and very many potential inferences, reasoners must somehow control the process of inference. Not all inferences are equally useful to a given reasoning system. Any reasoning system that has goals (or any form of a utility function) and acts based on its beliefs indirectly assigns utility to its beliefs. Given limits on the process of inference, and variation in the utility of inferences, it is clear that a reasoner ought to draw the inferences that will be most valuable to it. This paper presents an approach to this problem that makes the utility of a (potential) belief an explicit part of the inference process. The method is to generate explicit desires for knowledge. The question of focus of attention is thereby transformed into two related problems: How can explicit desires for knowledge be used to control inference and facilitate resource-constrained goal pursuit in general? and, Where do these desires for knowledge come from? We present a theory of knowledge goals, or desires for knowledge, and their use in the processes of understanding and learning. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel or unusual newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience.

"Title: Learning networks for face analysis and synthesis  
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the face-related projects in our group. The unifying theme underlying our work is the use of example-based learning methods for both analyzing and synthesizing face images. We label the example face images (and for the problem of face detection, ""near miss"" faces as well) with descriptive parameters for pose, expression, identity, and face vs. non-face. Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ","Title: Observations on Cortical Mechanisms for Object Recognition and Learning  
Abstract: This paper sketches several aspects of a hypothetical cortical architecture for visual object recognition, based on a recent computational model. The scheme relies on modules for learning from examples, such as Hyperbf-like networks, as its basic components. Such models are not intended to be precise theories of the biological circuitry but rather to capture a class of explanations we call Memory-Based Models (MBM) that contains sparse population coding, memory-based recognition and codebooks of prototypes. Unlike the sigmoidal units of some artificial neural networks, the units of MBMs are consistent with the usual description of cortical neurons as tuned to multidimensional optimal stimuli. We will describe how an example of MBM may be realized in terms of cortical circuitry and biophysical mechanisms, consistent with psychophysical and physiological data. A number of predictions, testable with physiological techniques, are made.

"Title: Raising GA Performance by Simultaneous Tuning of Selective Pressure and Recombination Disruptiveness  
Abstract: In many Genetic Algorithms applications the objective is to find a (near-)optimal solution using a limited amount of computation. Given these requirements it is difficult to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Usually such a balance is found by tuning the various parameters (like the selective pressure, population size, the mutation- and crossover rate) of the Genetic Algorithm. As an alternative we propose simultaneous tuning of the selective pressure and the disruptiveness of the recombination operators. Our experiments show that the combination of a proper selective pressure and a highly disruptive recombination operator yields superior performance. The reduction mechanism used in a Steady-State GA has a strong influence on the optimal crossover disruptiveness. Using the worst fitness deletion strategy the building blocks present in the current best individuals are always preserved. This releases the crossover operator from the burden to maintain good building blocks and allows us to tune crossover disruptiveness to improve the search for better individuals.","Title: Genetic algorithms with multi-parent recombination  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate genetic algorithms where more than two parents are involved in the recombination operation. In particular, we introduce gene scanning as a reproduction mechanism that generalizes classical crossovers, such as n-point crossover or uniform crossover, and is applicable to an arbitrary number (two or more) of parents. We performed extensive tests for optimizing numerical functions, the TSP and graph coloring to observe the effect of different numbers of parents. The experiments show that 2-parent recombination is outperformed when using more parents on the classical DeJong functions. For the other problems the results are not conclusive, in some cases 2 parents are optimal, while in some others more parents are better. ",1
"Title: of a simulator for evolving morphology are: Universal the simulator should cover an infinite gen
Abstract: Funes, P. and Pollack, J. (1997) Computer Evolution of Buildable Objects. Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life. P. Husbands and I. Harvey, eds., MIT Press. pp 358-367. knowledge into the program, which would result in familiar structures, we provided the algorithm with a model of the physical reality and a purely utilitarian fitness function, thus supplying measures of feasibility and functionality. In this way the evolutionary process runs in an environment that has not been unnecessarily constrained. We added, however, a requirement of computability to reject overly complex structures when they took too long for our simulations to evaluate. The results are encouraging. The evolved structures had a surprisingly alien look: they are not based in common knowledge on how to build with brick toys; instead, the computer found ways of its own through the evolutionary search process. We were able to assemble the final designs manually and confirm that they accomplish the objectives introduced with our fitness functions. After some background on related problems, we describe our physical simulation model for two-dimensional Lego structures, and the representation for encoding them and applying evolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of our work with photos of actual objects which were the result of particular optimizations. Finally, we discuss future work and draw some conclusions. In order to evolve both the morphology and behavior of autonomous mechanical devices which can be manufactured, one must have a simulator which operates under several constraints, and a resultant controller which is adaptive enough to cover the gap between simulated and real world. eral space of mechanisms. Conservative - because simulation is never perfect, it should preserve a margin of safety. Efficient - it should be quicker to test in simulation than through physical production and test. Buildable - results should be convertible from a simula tion to a real object Computer Evolution of Buildable Objects Abstract The idea of co-evolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has been constrained by the reality gap which implies that resultant objects are usually not buildable. The work we present takes a step in the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of parts. Evolution takes place in a simulator we designed, which computes forces and stresses and predicts failure for 2-dimensional Lego structures. The final printout of our program is a schematic assembly, which can then be built physically. We demonstrate its functionality in several different evolved entities.","Title: Evolving Self-Supporting Structures Page 18 References Evolution of Visual Control Systems for Robots. To appear
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our aim is to construct an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. The need to merge knowledge bases can arise, for example, when knowledge bases are acquired independently from interactions with several domain experts. As opinions of different domain experts may differ, the knowledge bases constructed in this way will normally differ too. A similar problem can also arise whenever separate knowledge bases are generated by learning algorithms. The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has a good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration, describe the implemented system (INTEG.3), and present some concrete results which demonstrate the advantages of this method.

"Title: A Comparison of Pruning Methods for Relational Concept Learning  
Abstract: Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning are two standard methods of dealing with noise in concept learning. Pre-Pruning methods are very efficient, while Post-Pruning methods typically are more accurate, but much slower, because they have to generate an overly specific concept description first. We have experimented with a variety of pruning methods, including two new methods that try to combine and integrate pre- and post-pruning in order to achieve both accuracy and efficiency. This is verified with test series in a chess position classification task.","Title: Mingers, 1989 J. Mingers. An empirical comparison of pruning methods for decision tree induction. Machine

"Title: CONVIS: Action Oriented Control and Visualization of Neural Networks Introduction and Technical Description  
Abstract: We show that two cooperating robots can learn exactly any strongly-connected directed graph with n indistinguishable nodes in expected time polynomial in n. We introduce a new type of homing sequence for two robots, which helps the robots recognize certain previously-seen nodes. We then present an algorithm in which the robots learn the graph and the homing sequence simultaneously by actively wandering through the graph. Unlike most previous learning results using homing sequences, our algorithm does not require a teacher to provide counterexamples. Furthermore, the algorithm can use efficiently any additional information available that distinguishes nodes. We also present an algorithm in which the robots learn by taking random walks. The rate at which a random walk on a graph converges to the stationary distribution is characterized by the conductance of the graph. Our random-walk algorithm learns in expected time polynomial in n and in the inverse of the conductance and is more efficient than the homing-sequence algorithm for high-conductance graphs.

Abstract: A performance prediction method is presented for indicating the performance range of MIMD parallel processor systems for neural network simulations. The total execution time of a parallel application is modeled as the sum of its calculation and communication times. The method is scalable because based on the times measured on one processor and one communication link, the performance, speedup, and efficiency can be predicted for a larger processor system. It is validated quantitatively by applying it to two popular neural networks, backpropagation and the Kohonen self-organizing feature map, decomposed on a GCel-512, a 512 transputer system. Agreement of the model with the measurements is within 9%.",1
"Title: Misclassification Minimization  
Abstract: The problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane, attempting to separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls in n-dimensional real space, is formulated as a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). This general LPEC can be converted to an exact penalty problem with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ""counts"" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.","Title: Induction of Oblique Decision Trees

"Title: Olfaction Metal Oxide Semiconductor Gas Sensors and Neural Networks  
Abstract: We apply recent results in Markov chain theory to Hastings and Metropolis algorithms with either independent or symmetric candidate distributions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithms to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . In the independence case (in IR k ) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of ; in the symmetric case (in IR only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective. ","Title: Gas Identification System using Graded Temperature Sensor and Neural Net Interpretation  
Abstract: We present results for three new algorithms for setting the step-size parameters, ff and , of temporal-difference learning methods such as TD(). The overall task is that of learning to predict the outcome of an unknown Markov chain based on repeated observations of its state trajectories. The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods. We compare our algorithms with conventional Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods have a natural way of setting the step size: for each state s they use a step size of 1=n s , where n s is the number of times state s has been visited. We seek and come close to achieving comparable step-size algorithms for TD(). One new algorithm uses a = 1=n s schedule to achieve the same effect as processing a state backwards with TD(0), but remains completely incremental. Another algorithm uses a at each time equal to the estimated transition probability of the current transition. We present empirical results showing improvement in convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods and conventional TD(). A limitation of our results at present is that they apply only to tasks whose state trajectories do not contain cycles. ",1
"Title: DYNAMIC CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE MODELS AND MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHODS  
Abstract: There are many applications in which it is desirable to order rather than classify instances. Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a preference function, of the form PREF(u; v), which indicates whether it is advisable to rank u before v. New instances are then ordered so as to maximize agreements with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a preference function is NP-complete, even under very restrictive assumptions. Nevertheless, we describe a simple greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a good approximation. We then discuss an on-line learning algorithm, based on the ""Hedge"" algorithm, for finding a good linear combination of ranking ""experts."" We use the ordering algorithm combined with the on-line learning algorithm to find a combination of ""search experts,"" each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a WWW search engine, and present experimental results that demonstrate the merits of our approach.

Abstract: Self-organizing feature maps are usually implemented by abstracting the low-level neural and parallel distributed processes. An external supervisor finds the unit whose weight vector is closest in Euclidian distance to the input vector and determines the neighborhood for weight adaptation. The weights are changed proportional to the Euclidian distance. In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved. It is also necessary to add a redundant dimension to the input vectors.",1

The bounds are based on probabilities over partitions of the union of in-sample and out-of-sample data into in-sample and out-of-sample data sets. The bounds apply when in-sample and out-of-sample data are drawn from the same distribution. Partition-based bounds are stronger than VC-type bounds, but they require more computation.

We present a method that loosely bounds the accuracy using the old method and uses the loose bound as an improved parameter value for tighter bounds. We show how to use the bounds in practice, and we generalize the bounds for individual classifiers to form uniform bounds over multiple classifiers. ",1

Results suggest that SASAT scales up better as the number of variables increases, solving at least as many hard SAT problems with less effort. The paper then presents an ablation study that helps to explain the relative advantage of SASAT over GSAT. Finally, an improvement to the basic SASAT algorithm is examined, based on a random walk suggested by Selman et al. (1993). ","Title: Optimal Mutation Rates in Genetic Search  
Abstract: The optimization of a single bit string by means of iterated mutation and selection of the best (a (1+1)-Genetic Algorithm) is discussed with respect to three simple fitness functions: The counting ones problem, a standard binary encoded integer, and a Gray coded integer optimization problem. A mutation rate schedule that is optimal with respect to the success probability of mutation is presented for each of the objective functions, and it turns out that the standard binary code can hamper the search process even in case of unimodal objective functions. While normally a mutation rate of 1=l (where l denotes the bit string length) is recommendable, our results indicate that a variation of the mutation rate is useful in cases where the fitness function is a multimodal pseudo-boolean function, where multimodality may be caused by the objective function as well as the encoding mechanism.",1
"Title: Learning Algorithms with Applications to Robot Navigation and Protein Folding  
Abstract: Using scene analysis as the task, this research focuses on three fundamental problems in neural network systems: (1) limited processing resources, (2) representing schemas, and (3) learning schemas. The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures. ","Title: Hidden Markov Models in Computational Biology: Applications to Protein Modeling UCSC-CRL-93-32 Keywords: Hidden Markov Models,
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PRO-FILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage ",1
"Title: Extracting Tree-Structured Representations of Trained Networks  
Abstract: A significant limitation of neural networks is that the representations they learn are usually incomprehensible to humans. We present a novel algorithm, Trepan, for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks. Our algorithm uses queries to induce a decision tree that approximates the concept represented by a given network. Our experiments demonstrate that Trepan is able to produce decision trees that maintain a high level of fidelity to their respective networks while being comprehensible and accurate. Unlike previous work in this area, our algorithm is general in its applicability and scales well to large net works and problems with high-dimensional input spaces.","Title: Submitted to the Future Generation Computer Systems special issue on Data Mining. Using Neural Networks
Abstract: Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. Neural-network methods are not commonly used for data-mining tasks, however, because they often produce incomprehensible models and require long training times. In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach, often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks. The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that, given the current state of the art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of data-mining specialists. ",1
"Title: On Learning Visual Concepts and DNF Formulae  
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning DNF formulae in the mistake-bound and the PAC models. We develop a new approach, which is called polynomial explainability, that is shown to be useful for learning some new subclasses of DNF (and CNF) formulae that were not known to be learnable before. Unlike previous learnability results for DNF (and CNF) formulae, these subclasses are not limited in the number of terms or in the number of variables per term; yet, they contain the subclasses of k-DNF and k-term-DNF (and the corresponding classes of CNF) as special cases. We apply our DNF results to the problem of learning visual concepts and obtain learning algorithms for several natural subclasses of visual concepts that appear to have no natural boolean counterpart. On the other hand, we show that learning some other natural subclasses of visual concepts is as hard as learning the class of all DNF formulae. We also consider the robustness of these results under various types of noise. ","Title: Learning Conjunctions of Horn Clauses

"Title: Soft Vector Quantization and the EM Algorithm Running Title: Soft Vector Quantization and EM Section:
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of graphs as a mathematical tool for expressing independenices, and as a formal language for communicating and processing causal information in statistical analysis. We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation. We exemplify the tradeoffs between the two approaches by deriving nonparametric bounds on treatment effects under conditions of imperfect compliance. ","Title: On Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures  
Abstract: We build up the mathematical connection between the ""Expectation-Maximization"" (EM) algorithm and gradient-based approaches for maximum likelihood learning of finite Gaussian mixtures. We show that the EM step in parameter space is obtained from the gradient via a projection matrix P , and we provide an explicit expression for the matrix. We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface. Based on these mathematical results, we present a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of EM and other algorithms for the learning of Gaussian mixture models.

"Title: LEARNING ROBOT BEHAVIORS USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: Genetic Algorithms are used to learn navigation and collision avoidance behaviors for robots. The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the The approach to learning behaviors for robots described here reflects a particular methodology for learning via a simulation model. The motivation is that making mistakes on real systems may be costly or dangerous. In addition, time constraints might limit the number of experiences during learning in the real world, while in many cases, the simulation model can be made to run faster than real time. Since learning may require experimenting with behaviors that might occasionally produce unacceptable results if applied to the real world, or might require too much time in the real environment, we assume that hypothetical behaviors will be evaluated in a simulation model (the off-line system). As illustrated in Figure 1, the current best behavior can be placed in the real, on-line system, while learning continues in the off-line system [1]. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The expectation is that behaviors learned in these simulations will be useful in real-world environments. Previous studies have illustrated that knowledge learned under simulation is robust and might be applicable to the real world if the simulation is more general (i.e. has more noise, more varied conditions, etc.) than the real world environment [2]. Where this is not possible, it is important to identify the differences between the simulation and the world and note the effect upon the learning process. The research reported here continues to examine this hypothesis. The next section very briefly explains the learning algorithm (and gives pointers to where more extensive documentation can be found). After that, the actual robot is described. Then we describe the simulation of the robot. The task _______________ actual robot.","Title: ROBO-SHEPHERD: LEARNING COMPLEX ROBOTIC BEHAVIORS

The case study involves a shepherding task in which one mobile robot attempts to guide another robot to a specified area. ",1
"Title: Learning in Continuous Domains with Delayed Rewards  
Abstract: Much has been done to develop learning techniques for delayed reward problems in worlds where the actions and/or states are approximated by discrete representations. Although this is acceptable in some applications there are many more situations where such an approximation is difficult and unnatural. For instance, in applications such as robotic,s where real machines interact with the real world, learning techniques that use real valued continuous quantities are required. Presented in this paper is an extension to Q-learning that uses both real valued states and actions. This is achieved by introducing activation strengths to each actuator system of the robot. This allow all actuators to be active to some continuous amount simultaneously. Learning occurs by incrementally adapting both the expected future reward to goal evaluation function and the gradients of that function with respect to each actuator system. ","Title: Learning Hierarchical Control Structures for Multiple Tasks and Changing Environments  
Abstract: While the need for hierarchies within control systems is apparent, it is also clear to many researchers that such hierarchies should be learned. Learning both the structure and the component behaviors is a difficult task. The benefit of learning the hierarchical structures of behaviors is that the decomposition of the control structure into smaller transportable chunks allows previously learned knowledge to be applied to new but related tasks. Presented in this paper are improvements to Nested Q-learning (NQL) that allow more realistic learning of control hierarchies in reinforcement environments. Also presented is a simulation of a simple robot performing a series of related tasks that is used to compare both hierarchical and non-hierarchal learning techniques. ",1

This paper identifies and demonstrates a new application area for network-based inference techniques - the management of causal analysis in clinical experimentation. These techniques, which were originally developed for medical diagnosis, are shown capable of circumventing one of the major problems in clinical experiments the assessment of treatment efficacy in the face of imperfect compliance. While standard diagnosis involves purely probabilistic inference in fully specified networks, causal analysis involves partially specified networks in which the links are given causal interpretation and where the domain of some variables are unknown. The system presented in this paper provides the clinical research community, we believe for the first time, an assumption-free, unbiased assessment of the average treatment effect. We offer this system as a practical tool to be used whenever full compliance cannot be enforced and, more broadly, whenever the data available is insufficient for answering the queries of interest to the clinical investigator.

The results reveal that despite the laxity of the encouraging instrument, indirect experimentation can yield significant and sometimes accurate information on the impact of a program on the population as a whole, as well as on the particular individuals who participated in the program.

"Title: AUTOMATED TOPOLOGY AND SIZING OF ANALOG CIRCUITS AUTOMATED DESIGN OF BOTH THE TOPOLOGY AND SIZING
Abstract: This paper describes an automated process for designing analog electrical circuits based on the principles of natural selection, sexual recombination, and developmental biology. The design process starts with the random creation of a large population of program trees composed of circuit-constructing functions. Each program tree specifies the steps by which a fully developed circuit is to be progressively developed from a common embryonic circuit appropriate for the type of circuit that the user wishes to design. Each fully developed circuit is translated into a netlist, simulated using a modified version of SPICE, and evaluated as to how well it satisfies the user's design requirements. The fitness measure is a user-written computer program that may incorporate any calculable characteristic or combination of characteristics of the circuit, including the circuit's behavior in the time domain, its behavior in the frequency domain, its power consumption, the number of components, cost of components, or surface area occupied by its components. The population of program trees is genetically bred over a series of many generations using genetic programming. Genetic programming is driven by a fitness measure and employs genetic operations such as Darwinian reproduction, sexual recombination (crossover), and occasional mutation to create offspring. This automated evolutionary process produces both the topology of the circuit and the numerical values for each component. This paper describes how genetic programming can evolve the circuit for a difficult-to-design low-pass filter. ","Title: A Comparison between Cellular Encoding and Direct Encoding for Genetic Neural Networks  
Abstract: This paper compares the efficiency of two encoding schemes for Artificial Neural Networks optimized by evolutionary algorithms. Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input.",1

Experimental tests show that this TDNN-T D() network can match the performance of our previous hand-engineered system. The tests also show that both neural network approaches significantly outperform the best previous (non-learning) solution to this problem in terms of the quality of the resulting schedules and the number of search steps required to construct them.","Title: How to Dynamically Merge Markov Decision Processes  
Abstract: We are frequently called upon to perform multiple tasks that compete for our attention and resource. Often we know the optimal solution to each task in isolation; in this paper, we describe how this knowledge can be exploited to efficiently find good solutions for doing the tasks in parallel. We formulate this problem as that of dynamically merging multiple Markov decision processes (MDPs) into a composite MDP, and present a new theoretically-sound dynamic programming algorithm for finding an optimal policy for the composite MDP. We analyze various aspects of our algorithm and Every day, we are faced with the problem of doing multiple tasks in parallel, each of which competes for our attention and resource. If we are running a job shop, we must decide which machines to allocate to which jobs, and in what order, so that no jobs miss their deadlines. If we are a mail delivery robot, we must find the intended recipients of the mail while simultaneously avoiding fixed obstacles (such as walls) and mobile obstacles (such as people), and still manage to keep ourselves sufficiently charged up. Frequently we know how to perform each task in isolation; this paper considers how we can take the information we have about the individual tasks and combine it to efficiently find an optimal solution for doing the entire set of tasks in parallel. More importantly, we describe a theoretically-sound algorithm for doing this merging dynamically; new tasks (such as a new job arrival at a job shop) can be assimilated online into the solution being found for the ongoing set of simultaneous tasks. illustrate its use on a simple merging problem.",1
"Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees. Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity.

"Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

Abstract: The boosting algorithm AdaBoost, developed by Freund and Schapire, has exhibited outstanding performance on several benchmark problems when using C4.5 as the ""weak"" algorithm to be ""boosted."" Like other ensemble learning approaches, AdaBoost constructs a composite hypothesis by voting many individual hypotheses. In practice, the large amount of memory required to store these hypotheses can make ensemble methods hard to deploy in applications. This paper shows that by selecting a subset of the hypotheses, it is possible to obtain nearly the same levels of performance as the entire set.

Abstract: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of a localized site in the somatosensory cortex of rats and monkeys for 2-6 hours produces a large increase in the cortical representation of the skin region represented by the ICMS-site neurons before ICMS, with very little effect on the ICMS-site neuron's RF location, RF size, and responsiveness (Recanzone et al., 1992). The ""EXIN"" (afferent excitatory and lateral inhibitory) learning rules (Marshall, 1995) are used to model RF changes during ICMS. The EXIN model produces reorganization of RF topography similar to that observed experimentally. The possible role of inhibitory learning in producing the effects of ICMS is studied by simulating the EXIN model with only lateral inhibitory learning. The model also produces an increase in the cortical representation of the skin region represented by the ICMS-site RF. ICMS is compared to artificial scotoma conditioning (Pettet & Gilbert, 1992) and retinal lesions (Darian-Smith & Gilbert, 1995), and it is suggested that lateral inhibitory learning may be a general principle of cortical plasticity.

Abstract: In this paper we describe different ways to select and transform features using evolutionary computation. The features are intended to serve as inputs to a feedforward network. The first way is the selection of features using a standard genetic algorithm, and the solution found specifies whether a certain feature should be present or not. We show that for the prediction of unemployment rates in various European countries, this is a succesfull approach. In fact, this kind of selection of features is a special case of so-called functional links. Functional links transform the input pattern space to a new pattern space. As functional links one can use polynomials, or more general functions. Both can be found using evolutionary computation. Polynomial functional links are found by evolving a coding of the powers of the polynomial. For symbolic functions we can use genetic programming. Genetic programming finds the symbolic functions that are to be applied to the inputs. We compare the workings of the latter two methods on two artificial datasets, and on a real-world medical image dataset.",1

Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) play a major role in many artificial-life systems, but there is often little detailed understanding of why the GA performs as it does, and little theoretical basis on which to characterize the types of fitness landscapes that lead to successful GA performance. In this paper we propose a strategy for addressing these issues. Our strategy consists of defining a set of features of fitness landscapes that are particularly relevant to the GA, and experimentally studying how various configurations of these features affect the GA's performance along a number of dimensions. In this paper we informally describe an initial set of proposed feature classes, describe in detail one such class (""Royal Road"" functions), and present some initial experimental results concerning the role of crossover and ""building blocks"" on landscapes constructed from features of this class.",1
"Title: Lookahead and Pathology in Decision Tree Induction  
Abstract: The standard approach to decision tree induction is a top-down, greedy algorithm that makes locally optimal, irrevocable decisions at each node of a tree. In this paper, we empirically study an alternative approach, in which the algorithms use one-level lookahead to decide what test to use at a node. We systematically compare, using a very large number of real and artificial data sets, the quality of decision trees induced by the greedy approach to that of trees induced using lookahead. The main observations from our experiments are: (i) the greedy approach consistently produced trees that were just as accurate as trees produced with the much more expensive lookahead step; and (ii) we observed many instances of pathology, i.e., lookahead produced trees that were both larger and less accurate than trees produced without it.","Title: Induction of Oblique Decision Trees  
Abstract: This paper introduces a randomized technique for partitioning examples using oblique hyperplanes. Standard decision tree techniques, such as ID3 and its descendants, partition a set of points with axis-parallel hyper-planes.

The purpose of this more general technique is to find smaller but equally accurate decision trees than those created by other methods. We have tested our algorithm on both real and simulated data, and found that in some cases it produces surprisingly small trees without losing predictive accuracy. Small trees allow us, in turn, to obtain simple qualitative descriptions of each problem domain.",1
"Title: Generating Accurate and Diverse Members of a Neural-Network Ensemble  
Abstract: Neural-network ensembles have been shown to be very accurate classification techniques. Previous work has shown that an effective ensemble should consist of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well. Most existing techniques, however, only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set of networks. In this paper we present a technique called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches. Experiments also show that Addemup is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble.","Title: Combining the Predictions of Multiple Classifiers: Using Competitive Learning to Initialize Neural Networks  
Abstract: The primary goal of inductive learning is to generalize well that is, induce a function that accurately produces the correct output for future inputs. Hansen and Salamon showed that, under certain assumptions, combining the predictions of several separately trained neural networks will improve generalization. One of their key assumptions is that the individual networks should be independent in the errors they produce. In the standard way of performing backpropagation this assumption may be violated, because the standard procedure is to initialize network weights in the region of weight space near the origin. This means that backpropagation's gradient-descent search may only reach a small subset of the possible local minima. In this paper we present an approach to initializing neural networks that uses competitive learning to intelligently create networks that are originally located far from the origin of weight space, thereby potentially increasing the set of reachable local minima. We report experiments on two real-world datasets where combinations of networks initialized with our method generalize better than combina tions of networks initialized the traditional way.",1
"Title: Generalizing from Case Studies: A Case Study  
Abstract: Most empirical evaluations of machine learning algorithms are case studies evaluations of multiple algorithms on multiple databases. Authors of case studies implicitly or explicitly hypothesize that the pattern of their results, which often suggests that one algorithm performs significantly better than others, is not limited to the small number of databases investigated, but instead holds for some general class of learning problems. However, these hypotheses are rarely supported with additional evidence, which leaves them suspect. This paper describes an empirical method for generalizing results from case studies and an example application. This method yields rules describing when some algorithms significantly outperform others on some dependent measures. Advantages for generalizing from case studies and limitations of this particular approach are also described.","Title: Rule Induction with CN2: Some Recent Improvements  
Abstract: The CN2 algorithm induces an ordered list of classification rules from examples using entropy as its search heuristic. In this short paper, we describe two improvements to this algorithm. Firstly, we present the use of the Laplacian error estimate as an alternative evaluation function and secondly, we show how unordered as well as ordered rules can be generated. We experimentally demonstrate significantly improved performances resulting from these changes, thus enhancing the usefulness of CN2 as an inductive tool. Comparisons with Quinlan's C4.5 are also made. ",1

Abstract: This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most RL research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.",1
"Title: Exploiting Choice: Instruction Fetch and Issue on an Implementable Simultaneous Multithreading Processor  
Abstract: Simultaneous multithreading is a technique that permits multiple independent threads to issue multiple instructions each cycle. In previous work we demonstrated the performance potential of simultaneous multithreading, based on a somewhat idealized model. In this paper we show that the throughput gains from simultaneous multithreading can be achieved without extensive changes to a conventional wide-issue superscalar, either in hardware structures or sizes. We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the best instructions to the processor. ","Title: Dynamic Hammock Predication for Non-predicated Instruction Set Architectures  
Abstract: Conventional speculative architectures use branch prediction to evaluate the most likely execution path during program execution. However, certain branches are difficult to predict. One solution to this problem is to evaluate both paths following such a conditional branch. Predicated execution can be used to implement this form of multi-path execution. Predicated architectures fetch and issue instructions that have associated predicates. These predicates indicate if the instruction should commit its result. Predicating a branch reduces the number of branches executed, eliminating the chance of branch misprediction at the cost of executing additional instructions. In this paper, we propose a restricted form of multi-path execution called Dynamic Predication for architectures with little or no support for predicated instructions in their instruction set. Dynamic predication dynamically predicates instruction sequences in the form of a branch hammock, concurrently executing both paths of the branch. A branch hammock is a short forward branch that spans a few instructions in the form of an if-then or if-then-else construct. We mark these and other constructs in the executable. When the decode stage detects such a sequence, it passes a predicated instruction sequence to a dynamically scheduled execution core. Our results show that dynamic predication can accrue speedups of up to 13%. ",1
"Title: A Simulation of Adaptive Agents in a Hostile Environment  
Abstract: In this paper we use the genetic programming technique to evolve programs to control an autonomous agent capable of learning how to survive in a hostile environment. In order to facilitate this goal, agents are run through random environment configurations. Randomly generated programs, which control the interaction of the agent with its environment, are recombined to form better programs. Each generation of the population of agents is placed into the Simulator with the ultimate goal of producing an agent capable of surviving any environment. The environment that an agent is presented consists of other agents, mines, and energy. The goal of this research is to construct a program which when executed will allow an agent (or agents) to correctly sense, and mark, the presence of items (energy and mines) in any environment. The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. These environments include one agent in a fixed environment, one agent in a fluctuating environment, and multiple agents in a fluctuating environment cooperating together. The genetic programming technique was extremely successful. The average fitness per generation in all three environments tested showed steady improvement. Programs were successfully generated that enabled an agent to handle any possible environment. ","Title: Strongly Typed Genetic Programming  
Abstract: BBN Technical Report #7866: Abstract Genetic programming is a powerful method for automatically generating computer programs via the process of natural selection [Koza 92]. However, it has the limitation known as ""closure"", i.e. that all the variables, constants, arguments for functions, and values returned from functions must be of the same data type. To correct this deficiency, we introduce a variation of genetic programming called ""strongly typed"" genetic programming (STGP). In STGP, variables, constants, arguments, and returned values can be of any data type with the provision that the data type for each such value be specified beforehand. This allows the initialization process and the genetic operators to only generate syntactically correct parse trees. Key concepts for STGP are generic functions, which are not true strongly typed functions but rather templates for classes of such functions, and generic data types, which are analogous. To illustrate STGP, we present four examples involving vector/matrix manipulation and list manipulation: (1) the multi-dimensional least-squares regression problem, (2) the multi-dimensional Kalman filter, (3) the list manipulation function NTH, and (4) the list manipulation function MAPCAR.",1
"Title: Learning to Achieve Goals  
Abstract: Temporal difference methods solve the temporal credit assignment problem for reinforcement learning. An important subproblem of general reinforcement learning is learning to achieve dynamic goals. Although existing temporal difference methods, such as Q learning, can be applied to this problem, they do not take advantage of its special structure. This paper presents the DG-learning algorithm, which learns efficiently to achieve dynamically changing goals and exhibits good knowledge transfer between goals. In addition, this paper shows how traditional relaxation techniques can be applied to the problem. Finally, experimental results are given that demonstrate the superiority of DG learning over Q learning in a moderately large, synthetic, non-deterministic domain.","Title: Transfer of Learning by Composing Solutions of Elemental Sequential Tasks  
Abstract: Although building sophisticated learning agents that operate in complex environments will require learning to perform multiple tasks, most applications of reinforcement learning have focussed on single tasks. In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs. I provide a proof of one aspect of the learning algorithm. ",1
"Title: Supporting Combined Human and Machine Planning: An Interface for Planning by Analogical Reasoning  
Abstract: Realistic and complex planning situations require a mixed-initiative planning framework in which human and automated planners interact to mutually construct a desired plan. Ideally, this joint cooperation has the potential of achieving better plans than either the human or the machine can create alone. Human planners often take a case-based approach to planning, relying on their past experience and planning by retrieving and adapting past planning cases. Planning by analogical reasoning in which generative and case-based planning are combined, as in Prodigy/Analogy, provides a suitable framework to study this mixed-initiative integration. However, having a human user engaged in this planning loop creates a variety of new research questions. The challenges we found creating a mixed-initiative planning system fall into three categories: planning paradigms differ in human and machine planning; visualization of the plan and planning process is a complex, but necessary task; and human users range across a spectrum of experience, both with respect to the planning domain and the underlying planning technology. This paper presents our approach to these three problems when designing an interface to incorporate a human into the process of planning by analogical reasoning with Prodigy/Analogy. The interface allows the user to follow both generative and case-based planning, it supports visualization of both plan and the planning rationale, and it addresses the variance in the experience of the user by allowing the user to control the presentation of information.","Title: A Case Study of Case-Based CBR  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning depends on multiple knowledge sources beyond the case library, including knowledge about case adaptation and criteria for similarity assessment. Because hand coding this knowledge accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. However, despite early interest in case-based approaches to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require, and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources. The paper closes with general lessons about case-based CBR and areas for future research.",1
"Title: Integrated Architectures for Learning, Planning, and Reacting Based on Approximating Dynamic Programming  
Abstract: This paper extends previous work with Dyna, a class of architectures for intelligent systems based on approximating dynamic programming methods. Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.","Title: LEARNING TO AVOID COLLISIONS: A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PARADIGM FOR MOBILE ROBOT NAVIGATION

Since in our case no `examples' are available, the system learns on the basis of an external reinforcement signal which is negative in case of a collision and zero otherwise. We describe the adaptive algorithm which is used for a discrete coding of the state space, and the adaptive algorithm for learning the correct mapping from the input (state) vector to the output (steering) signal.

We thank John Clement for the use of his protocol transcript, James Greeno for his contribution to developing our constructive modeling interpretation of it, and Ryan Tweney for his helpful comments Todd W. Griffith, Nancy J. Nersessian, and Ashok Goel Abstract We hypothesize generic models to be central in conceptual change in science. This hypothesis has its origins in two theoretical sources. The first source, constructive modeling, derives from a philosophical theory that synthesizes analyses of historical conceptual changes in science with investigations of reasoning and representation in cognitive psychology. The theory of constructive modeling posits generic mental models as productive in conceptual change. The second source, adaptive modeling, derives from a computational theory of creative design. Both theories posit situation independent domain abstractions, i.e. generic models. Using a constructive modeling interpretation of the reasoning exhibited in protocols collected by John Clement (1989) of a problem solving session involving conceptual change, we employ the resources of the theory of adaptive modeling to develop a new computational model, ToRQUE. Here we describe a piece of our analysis of the protocol to illustrate how our synthesis of the two theories is being used to develop a system for articulating and testing ToRQUE. The results of our research show how generic modeling plays a central role in conceptual change. They also demonstrate how such an interdisciplinary synthesis can provide significant insights into scientific reasoning. ","Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples  
Abstract: This paper describes the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME), a program for studying analogical processing. SME has been built to explore Gentner's Structure-mapping theory of analogy, and provides a ""tool kit"" for constructing matching algorithms consistent with this theory. Its flexibility enhances cognitive simulation studies by simplifying experimentation. Furthermore, SME is very efficient, making it a useful component in machine learning systems as well. We review the Structure-mapping theory and describe the design of the engine. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm, and demonstrate that most of the steps are polynomial, typically bounded by O (N 2 ). Next we demonstrate some examples of its operation taken from our cognitive simulation studies and work in machine learning. Finally, we compare SME to other analogy programs and discuss several areas for future work. This paper appeared in Artificial Intelligence, 41, 1989, pp 1-63.

Abstract: We build up the mathematical connection between the ""Expectation-Maximization"" (EM) algorithm and gradient-based approaches for maximum likelihood learning of finite Gaussian mixtures.

We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface. Based on these mathematical results, we present a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of EM and other algorithms for the learning of Gaussian mixture models.

Abstract: Inferences in measurement error models can be sensitive to modeling assumptions. Specifically, if the model is incorrect then the estimates can be inconsistent. To reduce sensitivity to modeling assumptions and yet still retain the efficiency of parametric inference we propose to use flexible parametric models which can accommodate departures from standard parametric models. We use mixtures of normals for this purpose. We study two cases in detail: a linear errors-in-variables model and a change-point Berkson model. fl Raymond J.

"Title: A study of the effects of group formation on evolutionary search  
Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the need for parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary. The transputer-based system presented in [Koza and Andre 1995] is one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a data-parallel approach [Tufts 1995], although others have exploited workstation farms and pipelined supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of different S-expressions when only a single instruction can be executed at the same time on every processor. The aim of this chapter is to present such an implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where each processor can efficiently evaluate a different S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for scientific experimentation, this is a useful approach. The idea of simulating a MIMD machine using a SIMD architecture is not new [Hillis and Steele 1986; Littman and Metcalf 1990; Dietz and Cohen 1992]. One of the original ideas for the Connection Machine [Hillis and Steele 1986] was that it could simulate other parallel architectures. Indeed, in the extreme, each processor on a SIMD architecture can simulate a universal Turing machine (TM). With different turing machine specifications stored in each local memory, each processor would simply have its own tape, tape head, state table and state pointer, and the simulation would be performed by repeating the basic TM operations simultaneously. Of course, such a simulation would be very inefficient, and difficult to program, but would have the advantage of being really MIMD, where no SIMD processor would be in idle state, until its simulated machine halts. Now let us consider an alternative idea, that each SIMD processor would simulate an individual stored program computer using a simple instruction set. For each step of the simulation, the SIMD system would sequentially execute each possible instruction on the subset of processors whose next instruction match it. For a typical assembly language, even with a reduced instruction set, most processors would be idle most of the time. However, if the set of instructions implemented on the virtual processor is very small, this approach can be fruitful. In the case of Genetic Programming, the ""instruction set"" is composed of the specified set of functions designed for the task. We will show below that with a precompilation step, simply adding a push, a conditional, and unconditional branching and a stop instruction, we can get a very effective MIMD simulation running. ","Title: Landscapes, Learning Costs and Genetic Assimilation.  
Abstract: The evolution of a population can be guided by phenotypic traits acquired by members of that population during their lifetime. This phenomenon, known as the Baldwin Effect, can speed the evolutionary process as traits that are initially acquired become genetically specified in later generations. This paper presents conditions under which this genetic assimilation can take place. As well as the benefits that lifetime adaptation can give a population, there may be a cost to be paid for that adaptive ability. It is the evolutionary trade-off between these costs and benefits that provides the selection pressure for acquired traits to become genetically specified. It is also noted that genotypic space, in which evolution operates, and phenotypic space, on which adaptive processes (such as learning) operate, are, in general, of a different nature. To guarantee an acquired characteristic can become genetically specified, then these spaces must have the property of neighbourhood correlation which means that a small distance between two individuals in phenotypic space implies that there is a small distance between the same two individuals in genotypic space.",1
"Title: Feature Selection via Mathematical Programming  
Abstract: The problem of discriminating between two finite point sets in n-dimensional feature space by a separating plane that utilizes as few of the features as possible, is formulated as a mathematical program with a parametric objective function and linear constraints. The step function that appears in the objective function can be approximated by a sigmoid or by a concave exponential on the nonnegative real line, or it can be treated exactly by considering the equivalent linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). Computational tests of these three approaches on publicly available real-world databases have been carried out and compared with an adaptation of the optimal brain damage (OBD) method for reducing neural network complexity. One feature selection algorithm via concave minimization (FSV) reduced cross-validation error on a cancer prognosis database by 35.4% while reducing problem features from 32 to 4. Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning [18, 15, 16, 17, 33]. In its basic form the problem consists of eliminating as many of the features in a given problem as possible, while still carrying out a preassigned task with acceptable accuracy. Having a minimal number of features often leads to better generalization and simpler models that can be more easily interpreted. In the present work, our task is to discriminate between two given sets in an n-dimensional feature space by using as few of the given features as possible. We shall formulate this problem as a mathematical program with a parametric objective function that will attempt to achieve this task by generating a separating plane in a feature space of as small a dimension as possible while minimizing the average distance of misclassified points to the plane. One of the computational experiments that we carried out on our feature selection procedure showed its effectiveness, not only in minimizing the number of features selected, but also in quickly recognizing and removing spurious random features that were introduced. Thus, on the Wisconsin Prognosis Breast Cancer WPBC database [36] with a feature space of 32 dimensions and 6 random features added, one of our algorithms FSV (11) immediately removed the 6 random features as well as 28 of the original features resulting in a separating plane in a 4-dimensional reduced feature space. By using tenfold cross-validation [35], separation error in the 4-dimensional space was reduced 35.4% from the corresponding error in the original problem space. (See Section 3 for details.) We note that mathematical programming approaches to the feature selection problem have been recently proposed in [4, 22]. Even though the approach of [4] is based on an LPEC formulation, both the LPEC and its method of solution are different from the ones used here. The polyhedral concave minimization approach of [22] is principally involved with theoretical considerations of one specific algorithm and no cross-validatory results are given. Other effective computational applications of mathematical programming to neural networks are given in [30, 26]. ","Title: Bilinear Separation of Two Sets in n-Space  
Abstract: The NP-complete problem of determining whether two disjoint point sets in the n-dimensional real space R n can be separated by two planes is cast as a bilinear program, that is minimizing the scalar product of two linear functions on a polyhedral set.

Encouraging computational experience on a number of test problems is reported.",1
"Title: Rigorous Learning Curve Bounds from Statistical Mechanics  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and investigate a mathematically rigorous theory of learning curves that is based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The advantage of our theory over the well-established Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory is that our bounds can be considerably tighter in many cases, and are also more reflective of the true behavior (functional form) of learning curves. This behavior can often exhibit dramatic properties such as phase transitions, as well as power law asymptotics not explained by the VC theory. The disadvantages of our theory are that its application requires knowledge of the input distribution, and it is limited so far to finite cardinality function classes. We illustrate our results with many concrete examples of learning curve bounds derived from our theory. ","Title: Towards Robust Model Selection using Estimation and Approximation Error Bounds  
Abstract: Let us present briefly the learning problem we will address in this chapter and the following. The ultimate goal is the modelling of a mapping f : x 7! y from multidimensional input x to output y. The output can be multi-dimensional, but we will mostly address situations where it is a one dimensional real value. Furthermore, we should take into account the fact that we scarcely ever observe the actual true mapping y = f (x). This is due to perturbations such as e.g. observational noise. We will rather have a joint probability p (x; y). We expect this probability to be peaked for values of x and y corresponding to the mapping. We focus on automatic learning by example. A set D = of data sampled from the joint distribution p (x; y) = p (yjx) p (x) is collected. With the help of this set, we try to identify a model of the data, parameterised by a set of 1.2 Learning and optimisation The fit of the model to the system in a given point x is measured using a criterion representing the distance from the model prediction b y to the system, e (y; f w (x)). This is the local risk .

"Title: Computational Models of Sensorimotor Integration  Computational Maps and Motor Control.  
Abstract: The sensorimotor integration system can be viewed as an observer attempting to estimate its own state and the state of the environment by integrating multiple sources of information. We describe a computational framework capturing this notion, and some specific models of integration and adaptation that result from it. Psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems, subserving the integration and adaptation of visuo-auditory maps, and estimation of the state of the hand during arm movements, are presented and analyzed within this framework. These results suggest that: (1) Spatial information from visual and auditory systems is integrated so as to reduce the variance in localization. (2) The effects of a remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space can be predicted from a simple learning rule. (3) The temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state is captured by a linear dynamic observer, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm.

"Title: Analysis of the Gibbs sampler for a model related to James-Stein estimators  
Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related to the usual empirical Bayes formulation of James-Stein estimators. We consider running a Gibbs sampler on this model. Using previous results about convergence rates of Markov chains, we provide rigorous, numerical, reasonable bounds on the running time of the Gibbs sampler, for a suitable range of prior distributions. We apply these results to baseball data from Efron and Morris (1975). For a different range of prior distributions, we prove that the Gibbs sampler will fail to converge, and use this information to prove that in this case the associated posterior distribution is non-normalizable.

We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective.

"Title: The Sources of Increased Accuracy for Two Proposed Boosting Algorithms  
Abstract: We introduce two boosting algorithms that aim to increase the generalization accuracy of a given classifier by incorporating it as a level-0 component in a stacked generalizer. Both algorithms construct a complementary level-0 classifier that can only generate coarse hypotheses for the training data. We show that the two algorithms boost generalization accuracy on a representative collection of data sets. The two algorithms are distinguished in that one of them modifies the class targets of selected training instances in order to train the complementary classifier. We show that the two algorithms achieve approximately equal generalization accuracy, but that they create complementary classifiers that display different degrees of accuracy and diversity. Our study provides evidence that it may be useful to investigate families of boosting algorithms that incorporate varying levels of accuracy and diversity, so as to achieve an appropriate mix for a given task and domain.

Machine Learning, 1(1):81-106,
Abstract: Although probabilistic inference in a general Bayesian belief network is an NP-hard problem, inference computation time can be reduced in most practical cases by exploiting domain knowledge and by making appropriate approximations in the knowledge representation. In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity. ",1
"Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice: A Roundtable Discussion  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods make possible the use of flexible Bayesian models that would otherwise be computationally infeasible. In recent years, a great variety of such applications have been described in the literature. Applied statisticians who are new to these methods may have several questions and concerns, however: How much effort and expertise are needed to design and use a Markov chain sampler? How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various ""tricks of the trade"". This paper is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC and to not-so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding convergence, assessing standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development. ","Title: On MCMC Sampling in Hierarchical Longitudinal Models  SUMMARY  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have revolutionized Bayesian practice. In their simplest form (i.e., when parameters are updated one at a time) they are, however, often slow to converge when applied to high-dimensional statistical models. A remedy for this problem is to block the parameters into groups, which are then updated simultaneously using either a Gibbs or Metropolis-Hastings step. In this paper we construct several (partially and fully blocked) MCMC algorithms for minimizing the autocorrelation in MCMC samples arising from important classes of longitudinal data models. We exploit an identity used by Chib (1995) in the context of Bayes factor computation to show how the parameters in a general linear mixed model may be updated in a single block, improving convergence and producing essentially independent draws from the posterior of the parameters of interest. We also investigate the value of blocking in non-Gaussian mixed models, as well as in a class of binary response data longitudinal models. We illustrate the approaches in detail with three real-data examples. ",1

Abstract: The dominant theme of case-based research at recent ML conferences has been on classifying cases represented by feature vectors. However, other useful tasks can be targeted, and other representations are often preferable.

"Title: Adaptation in constant utility non-stationary environments  
Abstract: Environments that vary over time present a fundamental problem to adaptive systems. Although in the worst case there is no hope of effective adaptation, some forms environmental variability do provide adaptive opportunities. We consider a broad class of non-stationary environments, those which combine a variable result function with an invariant utility function, and demonstrate via simulation that an adaptive strategy employing both evolution and learning can tolerate a much higher rate of environmental variation than an evolution-only strategy. We suggest that in many cases where stability has previously been assumed, the constant utility non-stationary environment may in fact be a more powerful viewpoint.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: Toward a Market Model for Bayesian Inference  
Abstract: We present a methodology for representing probabilistic relationships in a general-equilibrium economic model. Specifically, we define a precise mapping from a Bayesian network with binary nodes to a market price system where consumers and producers trade in uncertain propositions. We demonstrate the correspondence between the equilibrium prices of goods in this economy and the probabilities represented by the Bayesian network. A computational market model such as this may provide a useful framework for investigations of belief aggregation, distributed probabilistic inference, resource allocation under uncertainty, and other problems of de centralized uncertainty.","Title: Representing Aggregate Belief through the Competitive Equilibrium of a Securities Market  
Abstract: We consider the problem of belief aggregation: given a group of individual agents with probabilistic beliefs over a set of of uncertain events, formulate a sensible consensus or aggregate probability distribution over these events. Researchers have proposed many aggregation methods, although on the question of which is best the general consensus is that there is no consensus. We develop a market-based approach to this problem, where agents bet on uncertain events by buying or selling securities contingent on their outcomes. Each agent acts in the market so as to maximize expected utility at given securities prices, limited in its activity only by its own risk aversion. The equilibrium prices of goods in this market represent aggregate beliefs. For agents with constant risk aversion, we demonstrate that the aggregate probability exhibits several desirable properties, and is related to independently motivated techniques. We argue that the market-based approach provides a plausible mechanism for belief aggregation in multiagent systems, as it directly addresses self-motivated agent incentives for participation and for truthfulness, and can provide a decision-theoretic foundation for the ""expert weights"" often employed in centralized pooling techniques.",1

One consequence of this is that first-order acyclic determinate Horn programs with constant arity are exactly learnable from equiv alence and entailment membership queries.",1

Abstract: This paper deals with systems that are obtained from linear time-invariant continuous-or discrete-time devices followed by a function that just provides the sign of each output.

Results are given on observability, minimal realizations, and other system-theoretic concepts. Certain major differences exist with the linear case, and other results generalize in a surprisingly straightforward manner. ","Title: BACKPROPAGATION SEPARATES WHERE PERCEPTRONS DO  
Abstract: Feedforward nets with sigmoidal activation functions are often designed by minimizing a cost criterion. It has been pointed out before that this technique may be outperformed by the classical perceptron learning rule, at least on some problems. In this paper, we show that no such pathologies can arise if the error criterion is of a threshold LMS type, i.e., is zero for values ""beyond"" the desired target values. More precisely, we show that if the data are linearly separable, and one considers nets with no hidden neurons, then an error function as above cannot have any local minima that are not global. Simulations of networks with hidden units are consistent with these results, in that often data which can be classified when minimizing a threshold LMS criterion may fail to be classified when using instead a simple LMS cost. In addition, the proof gives the following stronger result, under the stated hypotheses: the continuous gradient adjustment procedure is such that from any initial weight configuration a separating set of weights is obtained in finite time. This is a precise analogue of the Perceptron Learning Theorem. The results are then compared with the more classical pattern recognition problem of threshold LMS with linear activations, where no spurious local minima exist even for nonseparable data: here it is shown that even if using the threshold criterion, such bad local minima may occur, if the data are not separable and sigmoids are used.

We assume that there is an unknown product distribution D over Q d such that all instances are independently drawn according to D.

"Title: Approximation with neural networks: Between local and global approximation  
Abstract: We investigate neural network based approximation methods. These methods depend on the locality of the basis functions. After discussing local and global basis functions, we propose a a multi-resolution hierarchical method. The various resolutions are stored at various levels in a tree. At the root of the tree, a global approximation is kept; the leafs store the learning samples themselves. Intermediate nodes store intermediate representations. In order to find an optimal partitioning of the input space, self-organising maps (SOM's) are used. The proposed method has implementational problems reminiscent of those encountered in many-particle simulations. We will investigate the parallel implementation of this method, using parallel hierarchical meth ods for many-particle simulations as a starting point.","Title: Using Many-Particle Decomposition to get a Parallel Self-Organising Map  
Abstract: We propose a method for decreasing the computational complexity of self-organising maps. The method uses a partitioning of the neurons into disjoint clusters. Teaching of the neurons occurs on a cluster-basis instead of on a neuron-basis. For teaching an N-neuron network with N 0 samples, the computational complexity decreases from O(N 0 N) to O(N 0 log N). Furthermore, we introduce a measure for the amount of order in a self-organising map, and show that the introduced algorithm behaves as well as the original algorithm.",1
"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Density Networks and their Application to Protein Modelling  
Abstract: I define a latent variable model in the form of a neural network for which only target outputs are specified; the inputs are unspecified.

The model can then discover for itself a description of the data in terms of an underlying latent variable space of lower dimensionality. I present preliminary results of the application of these models to protein data. ",1

","Title: Evolution in Time and Space The Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modifications compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.",1
"Title: Design, Analogy, and Creativity  
Abstract: : ","Title: GIT-CC-92/60 A Model-Based Approach to Analogical Reasoning and Learning in Design  
Abstract: A major issue in case-basedsystems is retrieving the appropriate cases from memory to solve a given problem. This implies that a case should be indexed appropriately when stored in memory. A case-based system, being dynamic in that it stores cases for reuse, needs to learn indices for the new knowledge as the system designers cannot envision that knowledge. Irrespective of the type of indexing (structural or functional), a hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models help in learning structural indices to design cases in the domain of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design provides both the vocabulary for structural indexing of design cases and the inductive biases for index generalization. We further discuss how model-based learning can be integrated with similarity-based learning (that uses prior design cases) for learning the level of index generalization. ",1

Abstract: This paper presents the formalization of a novel approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation in case-based reasoning (Cbr) for synthesis. The approach has been informally presented, exemplified, and implemented for the domain of industrial building design (Borner 1993). By relating the approach to existing theories we provide the foundation of its systematic evaluation and appropriate usage. Cases, the primary repository of knowledge, are represented structurally using an algebraic approach. Similarity relations provide structure preserving case modifications modulo the underlying algebra and an equational theory over the algebra (so available). This representation of a modeled universe of discourse enables theory-based inference of adapted solutions. The approach enables us to incorporate formally generalization, abstraction, geometrical transformation, and their combinations into Cbr. ",1
"Title: A Comparison between Cellular Encoding and Direct Encoding for Genetic Neural Networks  
Abstract: This paper compares the efficiency of two encoding schemes for Artificial Neural Networks optimized by evolutionary algorithms. Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input.","Title: Cellular Encoding Applied to Neurocontrol  
Abstract: Neural networks are trained for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. For one variant of the single pole system, only pole angle and cart position variables are supplied as inputs; the network must learn to compute velocities. All of the problems are solved using a fixed architecture and using a new version of cellular encoding that evolves an application specific architecture with real-valued weights. The learning times and generalization capabilities are compared for neural networks developed using both methods. After a post processing simplification, topologies produced by cellular encoding were very simple and could be analyzed. Architectures with no hidden units were produced for the single pole and the two pole problem when velocity information is supplied as an input. Moreover, these linear solutions display good generalization. For all the control problems, cellular encoding can automatically generate architectures whose complexity and structure reflect the features of the problem to solve.",1

Abstract: In this paper we carefully formulate a Schema Theorem for Genetic Programming (GP) using a schema definition that accounts for the variable length and the non-homologous nature of GP's representation. In a manner similar to early GA research, we use interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP Building Block definition and to state a ""classical"" Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by hierarchically combining building blocks. We report that this approach is not convincing for several reasons: it is difficult to find support for the promotion and combination of building blocks solely by rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically questionable whether building blocks always exist because partial solutions of consistently above average fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured; also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account of GP search behavior.",1

"Title: ADAPTIVE TESTING OF CONTROLLERS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES  
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to maintain vehicle performance in the presence of vehicle faults. The test and evaluation of complex software controllers is expected to be a challenging task. The goal of this e ffort is to apply machine learning techniques from the field of arti ficial intelligence to the general problem of evaluating an intelligent controller for an autonomous vehicle. The approach involves subjecting a controller to an adaptively chosen set of fault scenarios within a vehicle simulator, and searching for combinations of faults that produce noteworthy performance by the vehicle controller. The search employs a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the approach by evaluating the performance of a subsumption-based controller for an autonomous vehicle. The preliminary evidence suggests that this approach is an e ffective alternative to manual testing of sophisticated software controllers. ","Title: USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM TO LEARN BEHAVIORS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES  
Abstract: Truly autonomous vehicles will require both projec - tive planning and reactive components in order to perform robustly. Projective components are needed for long-term planning and replanning where explicit reasoning about future states is required. Reactive components allow the system to always have some action available in real-time, and themselves can exhibit robust behavior, but lack the ability to expli - citly reason about future states over a long time period. This work addresses the problem of creating reactive components for autonomous vehicles. Creating reactive behaviors (stimulus-response rules) is generally difficult, requiring the acquisition of much knowledge from domain experts, a problem referred to as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. SAMUEL is a system that learns reactive behaviors for autonomous agents. SAMUEL learns these behaviors under simulation, automating the process of creating stimulus-response rules and therefore reducing the bottleneck. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. Current work is investigating how well behaviors learned under simulation environments work in real world environments. In this paper, we describe SAMUEL, and describe behaviors that have been learned for simulated autonomous aircraft, autonomous underwater vehicles, and robots. These behaviors include dog fighting, missile evasion, track - ing, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. ",1

All rights reserved. Abstract We describe the results of performing data mining on a challenging medical diagnosis domain, acute abdominal pain. This domain is well known to be difficult, yielding little more than 60% predictive accuracy for most human and machine diagnosticians. Moreover, many researchers argue that one of the simplest approaches, the naive Bayesian classifier, is optimal. By comparing the performance of the naive Bayesian classifier to its more general cousin, the Bayesian network classifier, and to selective Bayesian classifiers with just 10% of the total attributes, we show that the simplest models perform at least as well as the more complex models. We argue that simple models like the selective naive Bayesian classifier will perform as well as more complicated models for similarly complex domains with relatively small data sets, thereby calling into question the extra expense necessary to induce more complex models. ","Title: Beyond Independence: Conditions for the Optimality of the Simple Bayesian Classifier  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC) is commonly thought to assume that attributes are independent given the class, but this is apparently contradicted by the surprisingly good performance it exhibits in many domains that contain clear attribute dependences. No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this finding lies in the distinction between classification and probability estimation: correct classification can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several sufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. The paper also reports empirical evidence of the SBC's competitive performance in domains containing substantial degrees of attribute dependence. ",1
"Title: First experiments using a mixture of nonlinear experts for time series prediction  
Abstract: This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of the mixture of experts (ME) model (introduced to the connectionist community in [JJNH91] and applied to time series analysis in [WM95]) on two time series where the dynamics is well understood. The first series is a computer-generated series, consisting of a mixture between a noise-free process (the quadratic map) and a noisy process (a composition of a noisy linear autoregressive and a hyperbolic tangent). There are three main results: (1) the ME model produces significantly better results than single networks; (2) it discovers the regimes correctly and also allows us to characterize the sub-processes through their variances. (3) due to the correct matching of the noise level of the model to that of the data it avoids overfitting. The second series is the laser series used in the Santa Fe competition; the ME model also obtains excellent out-of-sample predictions, allows for analysis and shows no overfitting.","Title: Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts and the EM Algorithm  
Abstract: We present a tree-structured architecture for supervised learning.

"Title: Factor Analysis Using Delta-Rule Wake-Sleep Learning  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 9607, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto We describe a linear network that models correlations between real-valued visible variables using one or more real-valued hidden variables a factor analysis model. This model can be seen as a linear version of the Helmholtz machine, and its parameters can be learned using the wake-sleep method, in which learning of the primary generative model is assisted by a recognition model, whose role is to fill in the values of hidden variables based on the values of visible variables. The generative and recognition models are jointly learned in wake and sleep phases, using just the delta rule. This learning procedure is comparable in simplicity to Oja's version of Hebbian learning, which produces a somewhat different representation of correlations in terms of principal components. We argue that the simplicity of wake-sleep learning makes factor analysis a plau sible alternative to Hebbian learning as a model of activity-dependent cortical plasticity.","Title: Recognizing Handwritten Digits Using Mixtures of Linear Models  
Abstract: We construct a mixture of locally linear generative models of a collection of pixel-based images of digits, and use them for recognition. Different models of a given digit are used to capture different styles of writing, and new images are classified by evaluating their log-likelihoods under each model. We use an EM-based algorithm in which the M-step is computationally straightforward principal components analysis (PCA). Incorporating tangent-plane information [12] about expected local deformations only requires adding tangent vectors into the sample covariance matrices for the PCA, and it demonstrably improves performance.",1
"Title: Forward models: Supervised learning with a distal teacher  
Abstract: Internal models of the environment have an important role to play in adaptive systems in general and are of particular importance for the supervised learning paradigm. In this paper we demonstrate that certain classical problems associated with the notion of the ""teacher"" in supervised learning can be solved by judicious use of learned internal models as components of the adaptive system. In particular, we show how supervised learning algorithms can be utilized in cases in which an unknown dynamical system intervenes between actions and desired outcomes. Our approach applies to any supervised learning algorithm that is capable of learning in multi-layer networks. *This paper is a revised version of MIT Center for Cognitive Science Occasional Paper #40.

","Title: Integrated Architectures for Learning, Planning, and Reacting Based on Approximating Dynamic Programming  
Abstract: This paper extends previous work with Dyna, a class of architectures for intelligent systems based on approximating dynamic programming methods. Dyna architectures integrate trial-and-error (reinforcement) learning and execution-time planning into a single process operating alternately on the world and on a learned model of the world. In this paper, I present and show results for two Dyna architectures. The Dyna-PI architecture is based on dynamic programming's policy iteration method and can be related to existing AI ideas such as evaluation functions and universal plans (reactive systems). Using a navigation task, results are shown for a simple Dyna-PI system that simultaneously learns by trial and error, learns a world model, and plans optimal routes using the evolving world model. The Dyna-Q architecture is based on Watkins's Q-learning, a new kind of reinforcement learning. Dyna-Q uses a less familiar set of data structures than does Dyna-PI, but is arguably simpler to implement and use. We show that Dyna-Q architectures are easy to adapt for use in changing environments.",1
"Title: Learning Distributions from Random Walks  
Abstract: We introduce a new model of distributions generated by random walks on graphs. This model suggests a variety of learning problems, using the definitions and models of distribution learning defined in [6]. Our framework is general enough to model previously studied distribution learning problems, as well as to suggest new applications. We describe special cases of the general problem, and investigate their relative difficulty. We present algorithms to solve the learning problem under various conditions.","Title: On the Learnability of Discrete Distributions (extended abstract)  
Abstract: We describe a model of iterated belief revision that extends the AGM theory of revision to account for the effect of a revision on the conditional beliefs of an agent. In particular, this model ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Adopting the Ramsey test, minimal conditional revision provides acceptance conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. We show that problem of determining acceptance of any such nested conditional can be reduced to acceptance tests for unnested conditionals. Thus, iterated revision can be accomplished in a virtual manner, using uniterated revision.",1
"Title: Implicit learning in 3D object recognition: The importance of temporal context  
Abstract: A novel architecture and set of learning rules for cortical self-organization is proposed. The model is based on the idea that multiple information channels can modulate one another's plasticity. Features learned from bottom-up information sources can thus be influenced by those learned from contextual pathways, and vice versa. A maximum likelihood cost function allows this scheme to be implemented in a biologically feasible, hierarchical neural circuit. In simulations of the model, we first demonstrate the utility of temporal context in modulating plasticity. The model learns a representation that categorizes people's faces according to identity, independent of viewpoint, by taking advantage of the temporal continuity in image sequences. In a second set of simulations, we add plasticity to the contextual stream and explore variations in the architecture. In this case, the model learns a two-tiered representation, starting with a coarse view-based clustering and proceeding to a finer clustering of more specific stimulus features. This model provides a tenable account of how people may perform 3D object recognition in a hierarchical, bottom-up fashion. ","Title: A Model of Invariant Object Recognition in the Visual System  
Abstract: Neurons in the ventral stream of the primate visual system exhibit responses to the images of objects which are invariant with respect to natural transformations such as translation, size, and view. Anatomical and neurophysiological evidence suggests that this is achieved through a series of hierarchical processing areas. In an attempt to elucidate the manner in which such representations are established, we have constructed a model of cortical visual processing which seeks to parallel many features of this system, specifically the multi-stage hierarchy with its topologically constrained convergent connectivity. Each stage is constructed as a competitive network utilising a modified Hebb-like learning rule, called the trace rule, which incorporates previous as well as current neuronal activity. The trace rule enables neurons to learn about whatever is invariant over short time periods (e.g. 0.5 s) in the representation of objects as the objects transform in the real world. The trace rule enables neurons to learn the statistical invariances about objects during their transformations, by associating together representations which occur close together in time. We show that by using the trace rule training algorithm the model can indeed learn to produce transformation invariant responses to natural stimuli such as faces.",1
"Title: Induction and Recapitulation of Deep Musical Structure  
Abstract: We describe recent extensions to our framework for the automatic generation of music-making programs. We have previously used genetic programming techniques to produce music-making programs that satisfy user-provided critical criteria. In this paper we describe new work on the use of connectionist techniques to automatically induce musical structure from a corpus. We show how the resulting neural networks can be used as critics that drive our genetic programming system. We argue that this framework can potentially support the induction and recapitulation of deep structural features of music. We present some initial results produced using neural and hybrid symbolic/neural critics, and we discuss directions for future work.","Title: Evolution of Pseudo-colouring Algorithms for Image Enhancement with Interactive Genetic Programming  
Abstract: Technical Report: CSRP-97-5 School of Computer Science The University of Birmingham Abstract In this paper we present an approach to the interactive development of programs for image enhancement with Genetic Programming (GP) based on pseudo-colour transformations. In our approach the user drives GP by deciding which individual should be the winner in tournament selection. The presence of the user does not only allow running GP without a fitness function but it also transforms GP into a very efficient search procedure capable of producing effective solutions to real-life problems in only hundreds of evaluations. In the paper we also propose a strategy to further reduce user interaction: we record the choices made by the user in interactive runs and we later use them to build a model which can replace him/her in longer runs. Experimental results with interactive GP and with our user-modelling strategy are also reported.",1
"Title: Rigorous Learning Curve Bounds from Statistical Mechanics  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and investigate a mathematically rigorous theory of learning curves that is based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The advantage of our theory over the well-established Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory is that our bounds can be considerably tighter in many cases, and are also more reflective of the true behavior (functional form) of learning curves. This behavior can often exhibit dramatic properties such as phase transitions, as well as power law asymptotics not explained by the VC theory. The disadvantages of our theory are that its application requires knowledge of the input distribution, and it is limited so far to finite cardinality function classes. We illustrate our results with many concrete examples of learning curve bounds derived from our theory. ","Title: An Experimental and Theoretical Comparison of Model Selection Methods on simple model selection problems, the
Abstract: We investigate the problem of model selection in the setting of supervised learning of boolean functions from independent random examples. More precisely, we compare methods for finding a balance between the complexity of the hypothesis chosen and its observed error on a random training sample of limited size, when the goal is that of minimizing the resulting generalization error. We undertake a detailed comparison of three well-known model selection methods | a variation of Vapnik's Guaranteed Risk Minimization (GRM), an instance of Rissanen's Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL), and cross validation (CV). We introduce a general class of model selection methods (called penalty-based methods) that includes both GRM and MDL, and provide general methods for analyzing such rules. We provide both controlled experimental evidence and formal theorems to support the following conclusions: * The class of penalty-based methods is fundamentally handicapped in the sense that there exist two types of model selection problems for which every penalty-based method must incur large generalization error on at least one, while CV enjoys small generalization error Despite the inescapable incomparability of model selection methods under certain circumstances, we conclude with a discussion of our belief that the balance of the evidence provides specific reasons to prefer CV to other methods, unless one is in possession of detailed problem-specific information. on both.",1
"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Information-based objective functions for active data selection  
Abstract: Learning can be made more efficient if we can actively select particularly salient data points. Within a Bayesian learning framework, objective functions are discussed which measure the expected informativeness of candidate measurements. Three alternative specifications of what we want to gain information about lead to three different criteria for data selection. All these criteria depend on the assumption that the hypothesis space is correct, which may prove to be their main weakness. ",1
"Title: Efficient Learning of Selective Bayesian Network Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computation-ally efficient method for inducing selective Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach is to use information-theoretic metrics to efficiently select a subset of attributes from which to learn the classifier. We explore three conditional, information-theoretic met-rics that are extensions of metrics used extensively in decision tree learning, namely Quin-lan's gain and gain ratio metrics and Man-taras's distance metric. We experimentally show that the algorithms based on gain ratio and distance metric learn selective Bayesian networks that have predictive accuracies as good as or better than those learned by existing selective Bayesian network induction approaches (K2-AS), but at a significantly lower computational cost. We prove that the subset-selection phase of these information-based algorithms has polynomial complexity, as compared to the worst-case exponential time complexity of the corresponding phase in K2-AS.","Title: Induction of Selective Bayesian Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine previous work on the naive Bayesian classifier and review its limitations, which include a sensitivity to correlated features. We respond to this problem by embedding the naive Bayesian induction scheme within an algorithm that carries out a greedy search through the space of features. We hypothesize that this approach will improve asymptotic accuracy in domains that involve correlated features without reducing the rate of learning in ones that do not. We report experimental results on six natural domains, including comparisons with decision-tree induction, that support these hypotheses. In closing, we discuss other approaches to extending naive Bayesian classifiers and outline some directions for future research. ",1
"Title: New Methods for Competitive Coevolution  
Abstract: We consider ""competitive coevolution,"" in which fitness is based on direct competition among individuals selected from two independently evolving populations of ""hosts"" and ""parasites."" Competitive coevolution can lead to an ""arms race,"" in which the two populations reciprocally drive one another to increasing levels of performance and complexity. We use the games of Nim and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe as test problems to explore three new techniques in competitive coevolution. ""Competitive fitness sharing"" changes the way fitness is measured, ""shared sampling"" provides a method for selecting a strong, diverse set of parasites, and the ""hall of fame"" encourages arms races by saving good individuals from prior generations. We provide several different motivations for these methods, and mathematical insights into their use. Experimental comparisons are done, and a detailed analysis of these experiments is presented in terms of testing issues, diversity, extinction, arms race progress measurements, and drift. ","Title: Improved Hoeffding-Style Performance Guarantees for Accurate Classifiers  
Abstract: Evolving Cooperative Groups: Preliminary Results Abstract Multi-agent systems require coordination of sources with distinct expertise to perform complex tasks effectively. In this paper, we use co-evolutionary approach using genetic algorithms to evolve multiple individuals who can effectively cooperate to solve a common problem. We concurrently run a GA for each individual in the group. In this paper, we experiment with a room painting domain which requires cooperation of two agents. We have used two mechanisms for evaluating an individual in one population: (a) pair it randomly with members from the other population, (b) pair it with members of the other population in a shared memory containing the best pairs found so far. Both the approaches are successful in generating optimal behavior patterns. However, our preliminary results exhibit a slight edge for the shared memory approach.",1
"Title: Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers. IBM Journal, 3(3):211-229, 1959. Some
Abstract: covering has been formalized and used extensively. In this work, the divide-and-conquer technique is formalized as well and compared to the covering technique in a logic programming framework. Covering works by repeatedly specializing an overly general hypothesis, on each iteration focusing on finding a clause with a high coverage of positive examples. Divide-and-conquer works by specializing an overly general hypothesis once, focusing on discriminating positive from negative examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that there are cases when more accurate hypotheses can be found by divide-and-conquer than by covering. Moreover, since covering considers the same alternatives repeatedly it tends to be less efficient than divide-and-conquer, which never considers the same alternative twice. On the other hand, covering searches a larger hypothesis space, which may result in that more compact hypotheses are found by this technique than by divide-and-conquer. Furthermore, divide-and-conquer is, in contrast to covering, not applicable to learn ing recursive definitions.","Title: Machine Learning Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences Keywords: Incremental learning, prediction,
Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",1
"Title: Rule-based Machine Learning Methods for Functional Prediction  
Abstract: We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.","Title: Combining estimates in regression and classification  
Abstract: We consider the problem of how to combine a collection of general regression fit vectors in order to obtain a better predictive model. The individual fits may be from subset linear regression, ridge regression, or something more complex like a neural network. We develop a general framework for this problem and examine a recent cross-validation-based proposal called ""stacking"" in this context. Combination methods based on the bootstrap and analytic methods are also derived and compared in a number of examples, including best subsets regression and regression trees. Finally, we apply these ideas to classification problems where the estimated combination weights can yield insight into the structure of the problem.",1
"Title: Dynamic Hammock Predication for Non-predicated Instruction Set Architectures  
Abstract: Conventional speculative architectures use branch prediction to evaluate the most likely execution path during program execution. However, certain branches are difficult to predict. One solution to this problem is to evaluate both paths following such a conditional branch. Predicated execution can be used to implement this form of multi-path execution. Predicated architectures fetch and issue instructions that have associated predicates. These predicates indicate if the instruction should commit its result. Predicating a branch reduces the number of branches executed, eliminating the chance of branch misprediction at the cost of executing additional instructions. In this paper, we propose a restricted form of multi-path execution called Dynamic Predication for architectures with little or no support for predicated instructions in their instruction set. Dynamic predication dynamically predicates instruction sequences in the form of a branch hammock, concurrently executing both paths of the branch. A branch hammock is a short forward branch that spans a few instructions in the form of an if-then or if-then-else construct. We mark these and other constructs in the executable. When the decode stage detects such a sequence, it passes a predicated instruction sequence to a dynamically scheduled execution core. Our results show that dynamic predication can accrue speedups of up to 13%. ","Title: Selective Eager Execution on the PolyPath Architecture  
Abstract: Control-flow misprediction penalties are a major impediment to high performance in wide-issue superscalar processors. In this paper we present Selective Eager Execution (SEE), an execution model to overcome mis-speculation penalties by executing both paths after diffident branches. We present the micro-architecture of the PolyPath processor, which is an extension of an aggressive superscalar, out-of-order architecture. The PolyPath architecture uses a novel instruction tagging and register renaming mechanism to execute instructions from multiple paths simultaneously in the same processor pipeline, while retaining maximum resource availability for single-path code sequences. Performance results of our detailed execution-driven, pipeline-level simulations show that the SEE concept achieves a potential average performance improvement of 48% on the SPECint95 benchmarks. A realistic implementation with a dynamic branch confidence estimator can improve performance by as much as 36% for the go benchmark, and an average of 14% on SPECint95, when compared to a normal superscalar, out-of-order, speculative execution, monopath processor. Moreover, our architectural model is both elegant and practical to implement, using a small amount of additional state and control logic. ",1

Abstract: Model learning combined with dynamic programming has been shown to be effective for learning control of continuous state dynamic systems. The simplest method assumes the learned model is correct and applies dynamic programming to it, but many approximators provide uncertainty estimates on the fit. How can they be exploited? This paper addresses the case where the system must be prevented from having catastrophic failures during learning. We propose a new algorithm adapted from the dual control literature and use Bayesian locally weighted regression models with stochastic dynamic programming. A common reinforcement learning assumption is that aggressive exploration should be encouraged. This paper addresses the converse case in which the system has to reign in exploration. The algorithm is illustrated on a 4 dimensional simulated control problem.",1
"Title: Building Intelligent Agents for Web-Based Tasks: A Theory-Refinement Approach  
Abstract: We present and evaluate an infrastructure with which to rapidly and easily build intelligent software agents for Web-based tasks. Our design is centered around two basic functions: ScoreThis-Link and ScoreThisPage. If given highly accurate such functions, standard heuristic search would lead to efficient retrieval of useful information. Our approach allows users to tailor our system's behavior by providing approximate advice about the above functions. This advice is mapped into neural network implementations of the two functions. Subsequent reinforcements from the Web (e.g., dead links) and any ratings of retrieved pages that the user wishes to provide are, respectively, used to refine the link- and page-scoring functions. Hence, our agent architecture provides an appealing middle ground between nonadaptive ""agent"" programming languages and systems that solely learn user preferences from the user's ratings of pages. We present a case study where we provide some simple advice and specialize our general-purpose system into a ""home-page finder"". An empirical study demonstrates that our approach leads to a more effective home-page finder than that of a leading commercial Web search engine.

Abstract: This article describes a comprehensive approach to automatic theory revision. Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory. The system has been tested in a variety of application domains, and results are presented for problems in the domains of molecular biology and plant disease diagnosis. ",1

"Title: Defining Relative Likelihood in Partially-Ordered Preferential Structures  
Abstract: Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.","Title: Rank-based systems: A simple approach to belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about evidence and actions.

Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.",1
"Title: Heterogeneous Uncertainty Sampling for Supervised Learning  
Abstract: Uncertainty sampling methods iteratively request class labels for training instances whose classes are uncertain despite the previous labeled instances. These methods can greatly reduce the number of instances that an expert need label. One problem with this approach is that the classifier best suited for an application may be too expensive to train or use during the selection of instances. We test the use of one classifier (a highly efficient probabilistic one) to select examples for training another (the C4.5 rule induction program). Despite being chosen by this heterogeneous approach, the uncertainty samples yielded classifiers with lower error rates than random samples ten times larger.","Title: Query by Committee  
Abstract: We propose an algorithm called query by committee, in which a committee of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms. ",1
"Title: Equivariant adaptive source separation  
Abstract: Source separation consists in recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation which implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called EASI (Equivariant Adaptive Separation via Independence). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating: this specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple, parallelizable structure, for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Close form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. This is completed by some numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches: onefor the best representation space, and twofor the best hypothesis in that space. In data-driven constructive induction (DCI), a learning system searches for a better representation space by analyzing the input examples (data). The presented data-driven constructive induction method combines an AQ-type learning algorithm with two classes of representation space improvement operators: constructors, and destructors. The implemented system, AQ17-DCI, has been experimentally applied to a GNP prediction problem using a World Bank database. The results show that decision rules learned by AQ17-DCI outperformed the rules learned in the original representation space both in predictive accuracy and rule simplicity.",1
"Title: A New Metric-Based Approach to Model Selection  
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to model selection that performs better than the standard complexity-penalization and hold-out error estimation techniques in many cases. The basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic metric structure of a hypothesis space, as determined by the natural distribution of unlabeled training patterns, and use this metric as a reference to detect whether the empirical error estimates derived from a small (labeled) training sample can be trusted in the region around an empirically optimal hypothesis. Using simple metric intuitions we develop new geometric strategies for detecting overfitting and performing robust yet responsive model selection in spaces of candidate functions. These new metric-based strategies dramatically outperform previous approaches in experimental studies of classical polynomial curve fitting. Moreover, the technique is simple, efficient, and can be applied to most function learning tasks. The only requirement is access to an auxiliary collection of unlabeled training data. ","Title: Generating Accurate and Diverse Members of a Neural-Network Ensemble  
Abstract: Neural-network ensembles have been shown to be very accurate classification techniques. Previous work has shown that an effective ensemble should consist of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well. Most existing techniques, however, only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set of networks. In this paper we present a technique called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches. Experiments also show that Addemup is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble.",1
"Title: Parzen. On estimation of a probability density function and mode. Annual Mathematical Statistics, 33:1065-1076, 1962.
Abstract: To apply the algorithm for classification we assign each class a separate set of codebook Gaussians. Each set is only trained with patterns from a single class. After having trained the codebook Gaussians, each set provides an estimate of the probability function of one class; just as with Parzen window estimation, we take as the estimate of the pattern distribution the average of all Gaussians in the set. Classification of a pattern may now be done by calculating the probability of each class at the respective sample point, and assigning to the pattern the class with the highest probability. Hence the whole codebook plays a role in the classification of patterns. This is not the case with regular classification schemes using codebooks. We have tested the classification scheme on several classification tasks including the two spiral problem. We compared our algorithm to various other classification algorithms and it came out second; the best algorithm for the applications is the Parzen window estimation. However, the computing time and memory for Parzen window estimation are excessive when compared to our algorithm, and hence, in practical situations, our algorithm is to be preferred. We have developed a fast algorithm which combines attractive properties of both Parzen window estimation and vector quantization. The scale parameter is tuned adaptively and, therefore, is not set in an ad hoc manner. It allows a classification strategy in which all the codebook vectors are taken into account. This yields better results than the standard vector quantization techniques. An interesting topic for further research is to use radially non-symmetric Gaussians.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the face-related projects in our group.

Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ",1
"Title: INFERENTIAL THEORY OF LEARNING: Developing Foundations for Multistrategy Learning  
Abstract: The development of multistrategy learning systems should be based on a clear understanding of the roles and the applicability conditions of different learning strategies. To this end, this chapter introduces the Inferential Theory of Learning that provides a conceptual framework for explaining logical capabilities of learning strategies, i.e., their competence. Viewing learning as a process of modifying the learners knowledge by exploring the learners experience, the theory postulates that any such process can be described as a search in a knowledge space, triggered by the learners experience and guided by learning goals. The search operators are instantiations of knowledge transmutations, which are generic patterns of knowledge change. Transmutations may employ any basic type of inferencededuction, induction or analogy. Several fundamental knowledge transmutations are described in a novel and general way, such as generalization, abstraction, explanation and similization, and their counterparts, specialization, concretion, prediction and dissimilization, respectively. Generalization enlarges the reference set of a description (the set of entities that are being described). Abstraction reduces the amount of the detail about the reference set. Explanation generates premises that explain (or imply) the given properties of the reference set. Similization transfers knowledge from one reference set to a similar reference set. Using concepts of the theory, a multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) methodology is outlined, and illustrated b y an example. MTL dynamically adapts strategies to the learning task, defined by the input information, learners background knowledge, and the learning goal. It aims at synergistically integrating a whole range of inferential learning strategies, such as empirical generalization, constructive induction, deductive generalization, explanation, prediction, abstraction, and similization. ","Title: In Machine Learning: A Multistrategy Approach, Vol. IV  Macro and Micro Perspectives of Multistrategy Learning  
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are perceived to have a great potential as means for the acquisition of knowledge; nevertheless, their use in complex engineering domains is still rare. Most machine learning techniques have been studied in the context of knowledge acquisition for well defined tasks, such as classification. Learning for these tasks can be handled by relatively simple algorithms. Complex domains present difficulties that can be approached by combining the strengths of several complementing learning techniques, and overcoming their weaknesses by providing alternative learning strategies. This study presents two perspectives, the macro and the micro, for viewing the issue of multistrategy learning. The macro perspective deals with the decomposition of an overall complex learning task into relatively well-defined learning tasks, and the micro perspective deals with designing multistrategy learning techniques for supporting the acquisition of knowledge for each task. The two perspectives are discussed in the context of ",1

Abstract: Technical Report 94-07 February 7, 1994 (updated April 25, 1994) This paper will appear in Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Machine Learning. Abstract This paper presents an algorithm for incremental induction of decision trees that is able to handle both numeric and symbolic variables.

Finally, a non-incremental method is given for finding a decision tree based on a direct metric of a candidate tree. ","Title: Learning Classification Trees  
Abstract: Algorithms for learning classification trees have had successes in artificial intelligence and statistics over many years. This paper outlines how a tree learning algorithm can be derived using Bayesian statistics. This introduces Bayesian techniques for splitting, smoothing, and tree averaging. The splitting rule is similar to Quinlan's information gain, while smoothing and averaging replace pruning. Comparative experiments with reimplementations of a minimum encoding approach, Quinlan's C4 (Quinlan et al., 1987) and Breiman et al.'s CART (Breiman et al., 1984) show the full Bayesian algorithm can produce Publication: This paper is a final draft submitted for publication to the Statistics and Computing journal; a version with some minor changes appeared in Volume 2, 1992, pages 63-73. more accurate predictions than versions of these other approaches, though pay a computational price.",1
"Title: Learning Approximate Control Rules Of High Utility  
Abstract: One of the difficult problems in the area of explanation based learning is the utility problem; learning too many rules of low utility can lead to swamping, or degradation of performance. This paper introduces two new techniques for improving the utility of learned rules. The first technique is to combine EBL with inductive learning techniques to learn a better set of control rules; the second technique is to use these inductive techniques to learn approximate control rules. The two techniques are synthesized in an algorithm called approximating abductive explanation based learning (AxA-EBL). AxA-EBL is shown to improve substantially over standard EBL in several domains.","Title: Learning Search-Control Heuristics for Logic Programs: Applications to Speedup Learning and Language Acquisition  
Abstract: This paper presents a general framework, learning search-control heuristics for logic programs, which can be used to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-based systems expressed as definite-clause logic programs. The approach combines techniques of explanation-based learning and recent advances in inductive logic programming to learn clause-selection heuristics that guide program execution. Two specific applications of this framework are detailed: dynamic optimization of Prolog programs (improving efficiency) and natural language acquisition (improving accuracy). In the area of program optimization, a prototype system, Dolphin is able to transform some intractable specifications into polynomial-time algorithms, and outperforms competing approaches in several benchmark speedup domains. A prototype language acquisition system, Chill is also described. It is capable of automatically acquiring semantic grammars, which uniformly incorprate syntactic and semantic constraints to parse sentences into case-role representations. Initial experiments show that this approach is able to construct accurate parsers which generalize well to novel sentences and significantly outperform previous approaches to learning case-role mapping based on connectionist techniques. Planned extensions of the general framework and the specific applications as well as plans for further evaluation are also discussed.",1

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in evaluating a case-based system. It describes the evaluation of Anapron, a system that pronounces names by a combination of rule-based and case-based reasoning. Three sets of experiments were run on Anapron: a set of exploratory measurements to profile the system's operation; a comparison between Anapron and other name-pronunciation systems; and a set of studies that modified various parts of the system to isolate the contribution of each.

Abstract: We describe the design and tuning of a controller for enforcing compliance with a prescribed velocity profile for a rail-based transportation system. This requires following a trajectory, rather than fixed set-points (as in automobiles). We synthesize a fuzzy controller for tracking the velocity profile, while providing a smooth ride and staying within the prescribed speed limits. We use a genetic algorithm to tune the fuzzy controller's performance by adjusting its parameters (the scaling factors and the membership functions) in a sequential order of significance. We show that this approach results in a controller that is superior to the manually designed one, and with only modest computational effort. This makes it possible to customize automated tuning to a variety of different configurations of the route, the terrain, the power configuration, and the cargo. ",1

Abstract: This paper presents first results of an interdisciplinary project in scientific data mining. We analyze data about the carcinogenicity of chemicals derived from the carcinogenesis bioassay program performed by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The database contains detailed descriptions of 6823 tests performed with more than 330 compounds and animals of different species, strains and sexes. The chemical structures are described at the atom and bond level, and in terms of various relevant structural properties. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects that various levels of detail and amounts of information have on the resulting hypotheses, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We apply relational and propositional machine learning algorithms to learning problems formulated as regression or as classification tasks. In addition, these experiments have been conducted with two learning problems which are at different levels of detail. Quantitatively, our experiments indicate that additional information not necessarily improves accuracy. Qualitatively, a number of potential discoveries have been made by the algorithm for Relational Regression because it can utilize all the information contained in the relations of the database as well as in the numerical dependent variable.

"Title: Hidden Markov Models in Computational Biology: Applications to Protein Modeling UCSC-CRL-93-32 Keywords: Hidden Markov Models,
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PRO-FILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage ","Title: Meta-MEME: Motif-based Hidden Markov Models of Protein Families  
Abstract: In a previous paper [SM95], we showed how finite automata could be used to define objective functions for assessing the quality of an alignment of two (or more) sequences.

We also show how to extend Hischberg's linear space algorithm [Hir75] to this setting, thus generalizing a result of Myers and Miller [MM88b]. ",1
"Title: Self-Targeting Candidates for Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms  
Abstract: The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for estimating a distribution is based on choosing a candidate Markov chain and then accepting or rejecting moves of the candidate to produce a chain known to have as the invariant measure. The traditional methods use candidates essentially unconnected to . Based on diffusions for which is invariant, we develop for one-dimensional distributions a class of candidate distributions that ""self-target"" towards the high density areas of . These produce Metropolis-Hastings algorithms with convergence rates that appear to be considerably better than those known for the traditional candidate choices, such as random walk. In particular, for wide classes of these choices may effectively help reduce the ""burn-in"" problem. We illustrate this behaviour for examples with exponential and polynomial tails, and for a logistic regression model using a Gibbs sampling algorithm.

Abstract: We apply recent results in Markov chain theory to Hastings and Metropolis algorithms with either independent or symmetric candidate distributions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithms to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . In the independence case (in IR k ) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of ; in the symmetric case (in IR only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective.

"Title: Using Errors to Create Piecewise Learnable Partitions  
Abstract: In this paper we describe an algorithm which exploits the error distribution generated by a learning algorithm in order to break up the domain which is being approximated into piecewise learnable partitions. Traditionally, the error distribution has been neglected in favor of a lump error measure such as RMS. By doing this, however, we lose a lot of important information. The error distribution tells us where the algorithm is doing badly, and if there exists a ""ridge"" of errors, also tells us how to partition the space so that one part of the space will not interfere with the learning of another. The algorithm builds a variable arity k-d tree whose leaves contain the partitions. Using this tree, new points can be predicted using the correct partition by traversing the tree. We instantiate this algorithm using memory based learners and cross-validation. ","Title: Hoeffding Races: Accelerating Model Selection Search for Classification and Function Approximation  
Abstract: Selecting a good model of a set of input points by cross validation is a computationally intensive process, especially if the number of possible models or the number of training points is high. Techniques such as gradient descent are helpful in searching through the space of models, but problems such as local minima, and more importantly, lack of a distance metric between various models reduce the applicability of these search methods. Hoeffding Races is a technique for finding a good model for the data by quickly discarding bad models, and concentrating the computational effort at differentiating between the better ones. This paper focuses on the special case of leave-one-out cross validation applied to memory-based learning algorithms, but we also argue that it is applicable to any class of model selection problems.

Abstract: A linear support vector machine formulation is used to generate a fast, finitely-terminating linear-programming algorithm for discriminating between two massive sets in n-dimensional space, where the number of points can be orders of magnitude larger than n. The algorithm creates a succession of sufficiently small linear programs that separate chunks of the data at a time. The key idea is that a small number of support vectors, corresponding to linear programming constraints with positive dual variables, are carried over between the successive small linear programs, each of which containing a chunk of the data. We prove that this procedure is monotonic and terminates in a finite number of steps at an exact solution that leads to a globally optimal separating plane for the entire dataset. Numerical results on fully dense publicly available datasets, numbering 20,000 to 1 million points in 32-dimensional space, confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the ability to handle very large problems.",1
"Title: Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension of Recurrent Neural Networks  
Abstract: Most of the work on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of neural networks has been focused on feedforward networks. However, recurrent networks are also widely used in learning applications, in particular when time is a relevant parameter. This paper provides lower and upper bounds for the VC dimension of such networks. Several types of activation functions are discussed, including threshold, polynomial, piecewise-polynomial and sigmoidal functions. The bounds depend on two independent parameters: the number w of weights in the network, and the length k of the input sequence. In contrast, for feedforward networks, VC dimension bounds can be expressed as a function of w only. An important difference between recurrent and feedforward nets is that a fixed recurrent net can receive inputs of arbitrary length. Therefore we are particularly interested in the case k w. Ignoring multiplicative constants, the main results say roughly the following: * For architectures with activation = any fixed nonlinear polynomial, the VC dimension is wk. * For architectures with activation = any fixed piecewise polynomial, the VC dimension is between wk and w 2 k. * For architectures with activation = H (threshold nets), the VC dimension is between w log(k=w) and minfwk log wk; w 2 + w log wkg. * For the standard sigmoid (x) = 1=(1 + e x ), the VC dimension is between wk and w 4 k 2 .

"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: FLAT MINIMA Neural Computation 9(1):1-42 (1997)  
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding low complexity neural networks with high generalization capability. The algorithm searches for a ""flat"" minimum of the error function. A flat minimum is a large connected region in weight-space where the error remains approximately constant. An MDL-based, Bayesian argument suggests that flat minima correspond to ""simple"" networks and low expected overfitting. The argument is based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. Unlike many previous approaches, ours does not require Gaussian assumptions and does not depend on a ""good"" weight prior instead we have a prior over input/output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set. Although our algorithm requires the computation of second order derivatives, it has backprop's order of complexity. Automatically, it effectively prunes units, weights, and input lines. Various experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In an application to stock market prediction, flat minimum search outperforms (1) conventional backprop, (2) weight decay, (3) ""optimal brain surgeon"" / ""optimal brain damage"". We also provide pseudo code of the algorithm (omitted from the NC-version). ",1

"Title: A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection  
Abstract: We review accuracy estimation methods and compare the two most common methods: cross-validation and bootstrap. Recent experimental results on artificial data and theoretical results in restricted settings have shown that for selecting a good classifier from a set of classifiers (model selection), ten-fold cross-validation may be better than the more expensive leave-one-out cross-validation. We report on a large-scale experiment|over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm|to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algorithms on real-world datasets. For cross-validation, we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not; for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, the best method to use for model selection is ten-fold stratified cross validation, even if computation power allows using more folds. ","Title: Cross-Validation and the Bootstrap: Estimating the Error Rate of a Prediction Rule  
Abstract: A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased, but can be highly variable. This article discusses bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. A particular bootstrap method, the 632+ rule, is shown to substantially outperform cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric, and apply to any possible prediction rule: however we only study classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include ""smooth"" prediction rules like Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function, and unsmooth ones like Nearest Neighbors.",1
"Title: Characterizing the generalization performance of model selection strategies  
Abstract: We investigate the structure of model selection problems via the bias/variance decomposition. In particular, we characterize the essential aspects of a model selection task by the bias and variance profiles it generates over the sequence of hypothesis classes. With this view, we develop a new understanding of complexity-penalization methods: First, the penalty terms can be interpreted as postulating a particular profile for the variances as a function of model complexityif the postulated and true profiles do not match, then systematic under-fitting or over-fitting results, depending on whether the penalty terms are too large or too small. Second, we observe that it is generally best to penalize according to the true variances of the task, and therefore no fixed penalization strategy is optimal across all problems. We then use this characterization to introduce the notion of easy versus hard model selection problems. Here we show that if the variance profile grows too rapidly in relation to the biases, then standard model selection techniques become prone to significant errors. This can happen, for example, in regression problems where the independent variables are drawn from wide-tailed distributions. To counter this, we discuss a new model selection strategy that dramatically outperforms standard complexity-penalization and hold-out meth ods on these hard tasks.","Title: A New Metric-Based Approach to Model Selection  
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to model selection that performs better than the standard complexity-penalization and hold-out error estimation techniques in many cases. The basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic metric structure of a hypothesis space, as determined by the natural distribution of unlabeled training patterns, and use this metric as a reference to detect whether the empirical error estimates derived from a small (labeled) training sample can be trusted in the region around an empirically optimal hypothesis. Using simple metric intuitions we develop new geometric strategies for detecting overfitting and performing robust yet responsive model selection in spaces of candidate functions. These new metric-based strategies dramatically outperform previous approaches in experimental studies of classical polynomial curve fitting. Moreover, the technique is simple, efficient, and can be applied to most function learning tasks. The only requirement is access to an auxiliary collection of unlabeled training data. ",1
"Title: Learning Singly-Recursive Relations from Small Datasets  
Abstract: The inductive logic programming system LOPSTER was created to demonstrate the advantage of basing induction on logical implication rather than -subsumption. LOPSTER's sub-unification procedures allow it to induce recursive relations using a minimum number of examples, whereas inductive logic programming algorithms based on -subsumption require many more examples to solve induction tasks. However, LOPSTER's input examples must be carefully chosen; they must be along the same inverse resolution path. We hypothesize that an extension of LOPSTER can efficiently induce recursive relations without this requirement. We introduce a generalization of LOPSTER named CRUSTACEAN that has this capability and empirically evaluate its ability to induce recursive relations. ","Title: The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut  
Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",1

Abstract: Technical Report Number CS94-394 Computer Science and Engineering, U.C.S.D. Abstract The developmental mechanisms transforming genotypic to phenotypic forms are typically omitted in formulations of genetic algorithms (GAs) in which these two representational spaces are identical. We argue that a careful analysis of developmental mechanisms is useful when understanding the success of several standard GA techniques, and can clarify the relationships between more recently proposed enhancements. We provide a framework which distinguishes between two developmental mechanisms | learning and maturation | while also showing several common effects on GA search. This framework is used to analyze how maturation and local search can change the dynamics of the GA. We observe that in some contexts, maturation and local search can be incorporated into the fitness evaluation, but illustrate reasons for considering them seperately. Further, we identify contexts in which maturation and local search can be distinguished from the fitness evaluation.

Abstract: A pilot study is described on the practical application of artificial neural networks. The limit cycle of the attitude control of a satellite is selected as the test case. One of the sources of the limit cycle is a position dependent error in the observed attitude. A Reinforcement Learning method is selected, which is able to adapt a controller such that a cost function is optimised. An estimate of the cost function is learned by a neural `critic'. In our approach, the estimated cost function is directly represented as a function of the parameters of a linear controller. The critic is implemented as a CMAC network. Results from simulations show that the method is able to find optimal parameters without unstable behaviour. In particular in the case of large discontinuities in the attitude measurements, the method shows a clear improvement compared to the conventional approach: the RMS attitude error decreases approximately 30%.

Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our aim is to construct an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. The need to merge knowledge bases can arise, for example, when knowledge bases are acquired independently from interactions with several domain experts. As opinions of different domain experts may differ, the knowledge bases constructed in this way will normally differ too. A similar problem can also arise whenever separate knowledge bases are generated by learning algorithms. The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has a good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration, describe the implemented system (INTEG.3), and present some concrete results which demonstrate the advantages of this method.

"Title: Environmental Effects on Minimal Behaviors in the Minimat World  
Abstract: The structure of an environment affects the behaviors of the organisms that have evolved in it. How is that structure to be described, and how can its behavioral consequences be explained and predicted? We aim to establish initial answers to these questions by simulating the evolution of very simple organisms in simple environments with different structures. Our artificial creatures, called ""minimats,"" have neither sensors nor memory and behave solely by picking amongst the actions of moving, eating, reproducing, and sitting, according to an inherited probability distribution. Our simulated environments contain only food (and multiple minimats) and are structured in terms of their spatial and temporal food density and the patchiness with which the food appears. Changes in these environmental parameters affect the evolved behaviors of minimats in different ways, and all three parameters are of importance in describing the minimat world. One of the most useful behavioral strategies that evolves is ""looping"" movement, which allows minimats-despite their lack of internal state-to match their behavior to the temporal (and spatial) structure of their environment. Ultimately we find that minimats construct their own environments through their individual behaviors, making the study of the impact of global environment structure on individual behavior much more complex. ","Title: EVOLVING SENSORS IN ENVIRONMENTS OF CONTROLLED COMPLEXITY  
Abstract: 1 . Sensors represent a crucial link between the evolutionary forces shaping a species' relationship with its environment, and the individual's cognitive abilities to behave and learn. We report on experiments using a new class of ""latent energy environments"" (LEE) models to define environments of carefully controlled complexity which allow us to state bounds for random and optimal behaviors that are independent of strategies for achieving the behaviors. Using LEE's analytic basis for defining environments, we then use neural networks (NNets) to model individuals and a steady - state genetic algorithm to model an evolutionary process shaping the NNets, in particular their sensors. Our experiments consider two types of ""contact"" and ""ambient"" sensors, and variants where the NNets are not allowed to learn, learn via error correction from internal prediction, and via reinforcement learning. We find that predictive learning, even when using a larger repertoire of the more sophisticated ambient sensors, provides no advantage over NNets unable to learn. However, reinforcement learning using a small number of crude contact sensors does provide a significant advantage. Our analysis of these results points to a tradeoff between the genetic ""robustness"" of sensors and their informativeness to a learning system. ",1

Abstract: Any system that learns how to filter documents will suffer poor performance during an initial training phase. One way of addressing this problem is to exploit filters learned by other users in a collaborative fashion. We investigate ""direct transfer"" of learned filters in this setting|a limiting case for any collaborative learning system. We evaluate the stability of several different learning methods under direct transfer, and conclude that symbolic learning methods that use negatively correlated features of the data perform poorly in transfer, even when they perform well in more conventional evaluation settings. This effect is robust: it holds for several learning methods, when a diverse set of users is used in training the classifier, and even when the learned classifiers can be adapted to the new user's distribution. Our experiments give rise to several concrete proposals for improving generalization performance in a collaborative setting, including a beneficial variation on a feature selection method that has been widely used in text categorization.

The model includes both phase and amplitude so that the time and the magnitude of the peak or nadir can be estimated. We also describe tests of fit for components in the model. Data from an experiment to study immunological responses in humans are used to demonstrate the methods. ",1
"Title: NIPS*97 Multiplicative Updating Rule for Blind Separation Derived from the Method of Scoring  
Abstract: For blind source separation, when the Fisher information matrix is used as the Riemannian metric tensor for the parameter space, the steepest descent algorithm to maximize the likelihood function in this Riemannian parameter space becomes the serial updating rule with equivariant property. This algorithm can be further simplified by using the asymptotic form of the Fisher information matrix around the equilibrium.","Title: A New Learning Algorithm for Blind Signal Separation  
Abstract: A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical dependency among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm is verified by computer simulations. ",1
"Title: Information-based objective functions for active data selection  
Abstract: Learning can be made more efficient if we can actively select particularly salient data points. Within a Bayesian learning framework, objective functions are discussed which measure the expected informativeness of candidate measurements. Three alternative specifications of what we want to gain information about lead to three different criteria for data selection. All these criteria depend on the assumption that the hypothesis space is correct, which may prove to be their main weakness. ","Title: In:  A Mixture Model System for Medical and Machine Diagnosis  
Abstract: Diagnosis of human disease or machine fault is a missing data problem since many variables are initially unknown. Additional information needs to be obtained. The joint probability distribution of the data can be used to solve this problem. We model this with mixture models whose parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. This gives the benefit that missing data in the database itself can also be handled correctly. The request for new information to refine the diagnosis is performed using the maximum utility principle. Since the system is based on learning it is domain independent and less labor intensive than expert systems or probabilistic networks. An example using a heart disease database is presented.",1
"Title: Non-linear Models for Time Series Using Mixtures of Experts  
Abstract: We consider a novel non-linear model for time series analysis. The study of this model emphasizes both theoretical aspects as well as practical applicability. The architecture of the model is demonstrated to be sufficiently rich, in the sense of approximating unknown functional forms, yet it retains some of the simple and intuitive characteristics of linear models. A comparison to some more established non-linear models will be emphasized, and theoretical issues are backed by prediction results for benchmark time series, as well as computer generated data sets. Efficient estimation algorithms are seen to be applicable, made possible by the mixture based structure of the model. Large sample properties of the estimators are discussed as well, in both well specified as well as misspecified settings. We also demonstrate how inference pertaining to the data structure may be made from the parameterization of the model, resulting in a better, more intuitive, understanding of the structure and performance of the model.","Title: Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts and the EM Algorithm

"Title: VISIT: An Efficient Computational Model of Human Visual Attention  
Abstract: One of the challenges for models of cognitive phenomena is the development of efficient and exible interfaces between low level sensory information and high level processes. For visual processing, researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many of the tasks required by high level vision. This thesis presents VISIT, a connectionist model of covert visual attention that has been used as a vehicle for studying this interface. The model is efficient, exible, and is biologically plausible. The complexity of the network is linear in the number of pixels. Effective parallel strategies are used to minimize the number of iterations required. The resulting system is able to efficiently solve two tasks that are particularly difficult for standard bottom-up models of vision: computing spatial relations and visual search. Simulations show that the networks behavior matches much of the known psychophysical data on human visual attention. The general architecture of the model also closely matches the known physiological data on the human attention system. Various extensions to VISIT are discussed, including methods for learning the component modules. ","Title: Unsupervised Neural Network Learning Procedures For Feature Extraction and Classification

Abstract: Results are presented that demonstrate the learning and fine-tuning of search strategies using connectionist mechanisms. Previous studies of strategy learning within the symbolic, production-rule formalism have not addressed fine-tuning behavior. Here a two-layer connectionist system is presented that develops its search from a weak to a task-specific strategy and fine-tunes its performance. The system is applied to a simulated, real-time, balance-control task. We compare the performance of one-layer and two-layer networks, showing that the ability of the two-layer network to discover new features and thus enhance the original representation is critical to solving the balancing task.

Abstract: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures specialized for prediction|that is, for using past experience with an incompletely known system to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by means of the difference between temporally successive predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods; and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. ",1

Abstract: Presenting and Analyzing the Results of AI Experiments: Data Averaging and Data Snooping, Proceedings of the Fourteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI-97, AAAI Press, Menlo Park, California, pp. 362367, 1997. Copyright AAAI. Presenting and Analyzing the Results of AI Experiments: Abstract Experimental results reported in the machine learning AI literature can be misleading. This paper investigates the common processes of data averaging (reporting results in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the results from multiple trials) and data snooping in the context of neural networks, one of the most popular AI machine learning models. Both of these processes can result in misleading results and inaccurate conclusions. We demonstrate how easily this can happen and propose techniques for avoiding these very important problems. For data averaging, common presentation assumes that the distribution of individual results is Gaussian. However, we investigate the distribution for common problems and find that it often does not approximate the Gaussian distribution, may not be symmetric, and may be multimodal. We show that assuming Gaussian distributions can significantly affect the interpretation of results, especially those of comparison studies. For a controlled task, we find that the distribution of performance is skewed towards better performance for smoother target functions and skewed towards worse performance for more complex target functions. We propose new guidelines for reporting performance which provide more information about the actual distribution (e.g. box-whiskers plots). For data snooping, we demonstrate that optimization of performance via experimentation with multiple parameters can lead to significance being assigned to results which are due to chance. We suggest that precise descriptions of experimental techniques can be very important to the evaluation of results, and that we need to be aware of potential data snooping biases when formulating these experimental techniques (e.g. selecting the test procedure). Additionally, it is important to only rely on appropriate statistical tests and to ensure that any assumptions made in the tests are valid (e.g. normality of the distribution).

"Title: First experiments using a mixture of nonlinear experts for time series prediction  
Abstract: This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of the mixture of experts (ME) model (introduced to the connectionist community in [JJNH91] and applied to time series analysis in [WM95]) on two time series where the dynamics is well understood. The first series is a computer-generated series, consisting of a mixture between a noise-free process (the quadratic map) and a noisy process (a composition of a noisy linear autoregressive and a hyperbolic tangent). There are three main results: (1) the ME model produces significantly better results than single networks; (2) it discovers the regimes correctly and also allows us to characterize the sub-processes through their variances. (3) due to the correct matching of the noise level of the model to that of the data it avoids overfitting. The second series is the laser series used in the Santa Fe competition; the ME model also obtains excellent out-of-sample predictions, allows for analysis and shows no overfitting.","Title: Nonlinear gated experts for time series: discovering regimes and avoiding overfitting  
Abstract: In: International Journal of Neural Systems 6 (1995) p. 373 - 399. URL of this paper: ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z, or http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~andreas/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z University of Colorado Computer Science Technical Report CU-CS-798-95. In the analysis and prediction of real-world systems, two of the key problems are nonstationarity(often in the form of switching between regimes), and overfitting (particularly serious for noisy processes). This article addresses these problems using gated experts, consisting of a (nonlinear) gating network, and several (also nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns to predict the conditional mean, and each expert adapts its width to match the noise level in its regime. The gating network learns to predict the probability of each expert, given the input. This article focuses on the case where the gating network bases its decision on information from the inputs. This can be contrasted to hidden Markov models where the decision is based on the previous state(s) (i.e., on the output of the gating network at the previous time step), as well as to averaging over several predictors. In contrast, gated experts soft-partition the input space. This article discusses the underlying statistical assumptions, derives the weight update rules, and compares the performance of gated experts to standard methods on three time series: (1) a computer-generated series, obtained by randomly switching between two nonlinear processes, (2) a time series from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition (the light intensity of a laser in chaotic state), and (3) the daily electricity demand of France, a real-world multivariate problem with structure on several time scales. The main results are (1) the gating network correctly discovers the different regimes of the process, (2) the widths associated with each expert are important for the segmentation task (and they can be used to characterize the sub-processes), and (3) there is less overfitting compared to single networks (homogeneous multi-layer perceptrons), since the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels. This can be viewed as matching the local complexity of the model to the local complexity of the data. ",1

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the face-related projects in our group. The unifying theme underlying our work is the use of example-based learning methods for both analyzing and synthesizing face images. We label the example face images (and for the problem of face detection, ""near miss"" faces as well) with descriptive parameters for pose, expression, identity, and face vs. non-face. Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ","Title: Models of perceptual learning in vernier hyperacuity  
Abstract: Performance of human subjects in a wide variety of early visual processing tasks improves with practice. HyperBF networks (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) constitute a mathematically well-founded framework for understanding such improvement in performance, or perceptual learning, in the class of tasks known as visual hyperacuity. The present article concentrates on two issues raised by the recent psychophysical and computational findings reported in (Poggio et al., 1992b; Fahle and Edelman, 1992). First, we develop a biologically plausible extension of the HyperBF model that takes into account basic features of the functional architecture of early vision. Second, we explore various learning modes that can coexist within the HyperBF framework and focus on two unsupervised learning rules which may be involved in hyperacuity learning. Finally, we report results of psychophysical experiments that are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent presynaptic amplification may be involved in perceptual learning in hyperacuity.

"Title: Experiments with a New Boosting Algorithm  
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we introduced a new boosting algorithm called AdaBoost which, theoretically, can be used to significantly reduce the error of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers whose performance is a little better than random guessing. We also introduced the related notion of a pseudo-loss which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's bagging method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute-value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem. ","Title: Why Does Bagging Work? A Bayesian Account and its Implications bagging's success, both in a
Abstract: The error rate of decision-tree and other classification learners can often be much reduced by bagging: learning multiple models from bootstrap samples of the database, and combining them by uniform voting. In this paper we empirically test two alternative explanations for this, both based on Bayesian learning theory: (1) bagging works because it is an approximation to the optimal procedure of Bayesian model averaging, with an appropriate implicit prior; (2) bagging works because it effectively shifts the prior to a more appropriate region of model space. All the experimental evidence contradicts the first hypothesis, and confirms the second. Bagging (Breiman 1996a) is a simple and effective way to reduce the error rate of many classification learning algorithms. For example, in the empirical study described below, it reduces the error of a decision-tree learner in 19 of 26 databases, by 4% on average. In the bagging procedure, given a training set of size s, a ""bootstrap"" replicate of it is constructed by taking s samples with replacement from the training set. Thus a new training set of the same size is produced, where each of the original examples may appear once, more than once, or not. On average, 63% of the original examples will appear in the bootstrap sample. The learning algorithm is then applied to this training set. This procedure is repeated m times, and the resulting m models are aggregated by uniform voting. Bagging is one of several ""multiple model"" approaches that have recently received much attention (see, for example, (Chan, Stolfo, & Wolpert 1996)). Other procedures of this type include boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) and stacking (Wolpert 1992). ",1
"Title: Robustness Analysis of Bayesian Networks with Finitely Generated Convex Sets of Distributions  
Abstract: This paper presents exact solutions and convergent approximations for inferences in Bayesian networks associated with finitely generated convex sets of distributions. Robust Bayesian inference is the calculation of bounds on posterior values given perturbations in a probabilistic model. The paper presents exact inference algorithms and analyzes the circumstances where exact inference becomes intractable. Two classes of algorithms for numeric approximations are developed through transformations on the original model. The first transformation reduces the robust inference problem to the estimation of probabilistic parameters in a Bayesian network. The second transformation uses Lavine's bracketing algorithm to generate a sequence of maximization problems in a Bayesian network.

Abstract: We derive a new self-organising learning algorithm which maximises the information transferred in a network of non-linear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisation of Principal Components Analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to ten speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information max-imisation provides a unifying framework for problems in `blind' signal processing. fl Please send comments to tony@salk.edu.

"Title: Theory Refinement Combining Analytical and Empirical Methods  
Abstract: This article describes a comprehensive approach to automatic theory revision. Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory. The system has been tested in a variety of application domains, and results are presented for problems in the domains of molecular biology and plant disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

"Title: A STUDY OF CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC PROGRAMMING  
Abstract: Holland's analysis of the sources of power of genetic algorithms has served as guidance for the applications of genetic algorithms for more than 15 years. The technique of applying a recombination operator (crossover) to a population of individuals is a key to that power. Neverless, there have been a number of contradictory results concerning crossover operators with respect to overall performance. Recently, for example, genetic algorithms were used to design neural network modules and their control circuits. In these studies, a genetic algorithm without crossover outperformed a genetic algorithm with crossover. This report re-examines these studies, and concludes that the results were caused by a small population size. New results are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of crossover when the population size is larger. From a performance view, the results indicate that better neural networks can be evolved in a shorter time if the genetic algorithm uses crossover.

Abstract: One way to represent a machine learning algorithm's bias over the hypothesis and instance space is as a pair of probability distributions. This approach has been taken both within Bayesian learning schemes and the framework of U-learnability. However, it is not obvious how an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system should best be provided with a probability distribution. This paper extends the results of a previous paper by the author which introduced stochastic logic programs as a means of providing a structured definition of such a probability distribution. Stochastic logic programs are a generalisation of stochastic grammars. A stochastic logic program consists of a set of labelled clauses p : C where p is from the interval [0; 1] and C is a range-restricted definite clause. A stochastic logic program P has a distributional semantics, that is one which assigns a probability distribution to the atoms of each predicate in the Herbrand base of the clauses in P . These probabilities are assigned to atoms according to an SLD-resolution strategy which employs a stochastic selection rule. It is shown that the probabilities can be computed directly for fail-free logic programs and by normalisation for arbitrary logic programs. The stochastic proof strategy can be used to provide three distinct functions: 1) a method of sampling from the Herbrand base which can be used to provide selected targets or example sets for ILP experiments, 2) a measure of the information content of examples or hypotheses; this can be used to guide the search in an ILP system and 3) a simple method for conditioning a given stochastic logic program on samples of data. Functions 1) and 3) are used to measure the generality of hypotheses in the ILP system Progol4.2. This supports an implementation of a Bayesian technique for learning from positive examples only. fl This paper is an extension of a paper with the same title which appeared in [12] ",1

Abstract: We consider the use of ""on-line"" stopping rules to reduce the number of training examples needed to pac-learn. Rather than collect a large training sample that can be proved sufficient to eliminate all bad hypotheses a priori, the idea is instead to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide ""on-line"" whether to stop and return a hypothesis, or continue training. The primary benefit of this approach is that we can detect when a hypothesizer has actually ""converged,"" and halt training before the standard fixed-sample-size bounds. This paper presents a series of such sequential learning procedures for: distribution-free pac-learning, ""mistake-bounded to pac"" conversion, and distribution-specific pac-learning, respectively. We analyze the worst case expected training sample size of these procedures, and show that this is often smaller than existing fixed sample size bounds | while providing the exact same worst case pac-guarantees. We also provide lower bounds that show these reductions can at best involve constant (and possibly log) factors. However, empirical studies show that these sequential learning procedures actually use many times fewer training examples in prac tice.",0

"Title: Mutual Information as a Bayesian Measure of Independence  
Abstract: 0.0 Abstract. The problem of hypothesis testing is examined from both the historical and the Bayesian points of view in the case that sampling is from an underlying joint probability distribution and the hypotheses tested for are those of independence and dependence of the underlying distribution. Exact results for the Bayesian method are provided. Asymptotic Bayesian results and historical method quantities are compared, and historical method quantities are interpreted in terms of clearly defined Bayesian quantities. The asymptotic Bayesian test relies upon a statistic that is predominantly mutual information. Problems of hypothesis testing arise ubiquitously in situations where observed data is produced by an unknown process and the question is asked From what process did this observed data arise? Historically, the hypothesis testing problem is approached from the point of view of sampling, whereby several fixed hypotheses to be tested for are given, and all measures of the test and its quality are found directly from the likelihood, i.e. by what amounts to sampling the likelihood [2] [3]. (To be specific, a hypothesis is a set of possible parameter vectors, each parameter vector completely specifying a sampling distribution. A simple hypothesis is a hypothesis set that contains one parameter vector. A composite hypothesis occurs when the (nonempty) hypothesis set is not a single parameter vector.) Generally, the test procedure chooses as true the hypothesis that gives the largest test value, although the notion of procedure is not specific and may refer to any method for choosing the hypothesis given the test values. Since it is of interest to quantify the quality of the test, a level of significance is generated, this level being the probability that, under the chosen hypothesis and test procedure, an incorrect hypothesis choice is made. The significance is generated using the sampling distribution, or likelihood. For simple hypotheses the level of significance is found using the single parameter value of the hypothesis. When a test is applied in the case of a composite hypothesis, a size for the test is found that is given by the supremum probability (ranging over the parameter vectors in the hypothesis set) that under the chosen ","Title: Counterfactuals and Policy Analysis in Structural Models

Abstract: Although Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a natural formulation for many problems, our previous work on CBR as applied to design made it apparent that there were elements of the CBR paradigm that prevented it from being more widely applied. At the same time, we were evaluating Constraint Satisfaction techniques for design, and found a commonality in motivation between repair-based constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and case adaptation. This led us to combine the two methodologies in order to gain the advantages of CSP for case-based reasoning, allowing CBR to be more widely and flexibly applied. In combining the two methodologies, we found some unexpected synergy and commonality between the approaches.

Abstract: Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.","Title: Avoiding overfitting by locally matching the noise level of the data gating network discovers the
Abstract: When trying to forecast the future behavior of a real-world system, two of the key problems are nonstationarity of the process (e.g., regime switching) and overfitting of the model (particularly serious for noisy processes). This articles shows how gated experts can point to solutions to these problems. The architecture, also called society of experts and mixture of experts consists of a (nonlinear) gating network and several (nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns a conditional mean (as usual), but each expert also has its own adaptive width. The gating network learns to assign a probability to each expert that depends on the input. This article first discusses the assumptions underlying this architecture and derives the weight update rules. It then evaluates the performance of gated experts in comparison to that of single networks, as well as to networks with two outputs, one predicting the mean, the other one the local error bar. This article also investigates the ability of gated experts to discover and characterize underlying the regimes. The results are: * there is significantly less overfitting compared to single nets, for two reasons: only subsets of the potential inputs are given to the experts and gating network (less of a curse of dimensionality), and the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels, thus only learning as This article focuses on the architecture and the overfitting problem. Applications to a computer-generated toy problem and the laser data from Santa Fe Competition are given in [Mangeas and Weigend, 1995], and the application to the real-world problem of predicting the electricity demand of France are given in [Mangeas et al., 1995]. much as the data support.",0
"Title: AN EFFICIENT METRIC FOR HETEROGENEOUS INDUCTIVE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN THE ATTRIBUTE-VALUE LANGUAGE 1  
Abstract: Many inductive learning problems can be expressed in the classical attribute-value language. In order to learn and to generalize, learning systems often rely on some measure of similarity between their current knowledge base and new information. The attribute-value language defines a heterogeneous multidimensional input space, where some attributes are nominal and others linear. Defining similarity, or proximity, of two points in such input spaces is non trivial. We discuss two representative homogeneous metrics and show examples of why they are limited to their own domains. We then address the issues raised by the design of a heterogeneous metric for inductive learning systems. In particular, we discuss the need for normalization and the impact of don't-care values. We propose a heterogeneous metric and evaluate it empirically on a simplified version of ILA. ","Title: Global Stabilization of Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Bounded Feedback  
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of global stabilization of linear discrete time systems by means of bounded feedback laws. The main result proved is an analog of one proved for the continuous time case by the authors, and shows that such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable with arbitrary controls and the transition matrix has spectral radius less or equal to one. The proof provides in principle an algorithm for the construction of such feedback laws, which can be implemented either as cascades or as parallel connections (""single hidden layer neural networks"") of simple saturation functions.

"Title: A note on acceptance rate criteria for CLTs for Hastings-Metropolis algorithms  
Abstract: This note considers positive recurrent Markov chains where the probability of remaining in the current state is arbitrarily close to 1. Specifically, conditions are given which ensure the non-existence of central limit theorems for ergodic averages of functionals of the chain. The results are motivated by applications for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms which are constructed in terms of a rejection probability, (where a rejection involves remaining at the current state). Two examples for commonly used algorithms are given, for the independence sampler and the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. The examples are rather specialised, although in both cases, the problems which arise are typical of problems commonly occurring for the particular algorithm being used. 0 I would like to thank Kerrie Mengersen Jeff Rosenthal and Richard Tweedie for useful conversations on the subject of this paper. ","Title: Hierarchical Genetic Programming (HGP) extensions discover, modify, and exploit subroutines to accelerate the evolution of
Abstract: A fundamental problem in learning from observation and interaction with an environment is defining a good representation, that is a representation which captures the underlying structure and functionality of the domain. This chapter discusses an extension of the genetic programming (GP) paradigm based on the idea that subroutines obtained from blocks of good representations act as building blocks and may enable a faster evolution of even better representations. This GP extension algorithm is called adaptive representation through learning (ARL). It has built-in mechanisms for (1) creation of new subroutines through discovery and generalization of blocks of code; (2) deletion of subroutines. The set of evolved subroutines extracts common knowledge emerging during the evolutionary process and acquires the necessary structure for solving the problem. ARL was successfully tested on the problem of controlling an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment. Results with the automatic discovery of subroutines show the potential to better scale up the GP technique to complex problems. While HGP approaches improve the efficiency and scalability of genetic programming (GP) for many applications [Koza, 1994b], several issues remain unresolved. The scalability of HGP techniques could be further improved by solving two such issues. One is the characterization of the value of subroutines. Current methods for HGP do not attempt to decide what is relevant, i.e. which blocks of code or subroutines may be worth giving special attention, but employ genetic operations on subroutines at random points. The other issue is the time-course of the generation of new subroutines. Current HGP techniques do not make informed choices to automatically decide when creation or modification of subroutines is advantageous or necessary. The Adaptive Representation through Learning (ARL) algorithm copes with both of these problems. The what issue is addressed by relying on local measures such as parent-offspring differential fitness and block activation in order to discover useful subroutines and by learning which subroutines are useful. The when issue is addressed by relying on global population measures such as population entropy in order to predict when search reaches local optima and escape them. ARL co-evolves a set of subroutines which extends the set of problem primitives. ",0
"Title: Computational Learning in Humans and Machines  
Abstract: In this paper we review research on machine learning and its relation to computational models of human learning. We focus initially on concept induction, examining five main approaches to this problem, then consider the more complex issue of learning sequential behaviors. After this, we compare the rhetoric that sometimes appears in the machine learning and psychological literature with the growing evidence that different theoretical paradigms typically produce similar results. In response, we suggest that concrete computational models, which currently dominate the field, may be less useful than simulations that operate at a more abstract level. We illustrate this point with an abstract simulation that explains a challenging phenomenon in the area of category learning, and we conclude with some general observations about such abstract models. ","Title: Entailment for Specification Refinement  
Abstract: Specification refinement is part of formal program derivation, a method by which software is directly constructed from a provably correct specification. Because program derivation is an intensive manual exercise used for critical software systems, an automated approach would allow it to be viable for many other types of software systems. The goal of this research is to determine if genetic programming (GP) can be used to automate the specification refinement process. The initial steps toward this goal are to show that a well-known proof logic for program derivation can be encoded such that a GP-based system can infer sentences in the logic for proof of a particular sentence. The results are promising and indicate that GP can be useful in aiding pro gram derivation.",0
"Title: The Task Rehearsal Method of Sequential Learning  
Abstract: An hypothesis of functional transfer of task knowledge is presented that requires the development of a measure of task relatedness and a method of sequential learning. The task rehearsal method (TRM) is introduced to address the issues of sequential learning, namely retention and transfer of knowledge. TRM is a knowledge based inductive learning system that uses functional domain knowledge as a source of inductive bias. The representations of successfully learned tasks are stored within domain knowledge. Virtual examples generated by domain knowledge are rehearsed in parallel with the each new task using either the standard multiple task learning (MTL) or the MTL neural network methods. The results of experiments conducted on a synthetic domain of seven tasks demonstrate the method's ability to retain and transfer task knowledge. TRM is shown to be effective in developing hypothesis for tasks that suffer from impoverished training sets. Difficulties encountered during sequential learning over the diverse domain reinforce the need for a more robust measure of task relatedness.

Abstract: This paper describes a new method for inducing logic programs from examples which attempts to integrate the best aspects of existing ILP methods into a single coherent framework. In particular, it combines a bottom-up method similar to Golem with a top-down method similar to Foil. It also includes a method for predicate invention similar to Champ and an elegant solution to the ""noisy oracle"" problem which allows the system to learn recursive programs without requiring a complete set of positive examples. Systematic experimental comparisons to both Golem and Foil on a range of problems are used to clearly demonstrate the ad vantages of the approach.","Title: GENERALIZATION BY CONTROLLED EXPANSION OF EXAMPLES  
Abstract: SG (Specific to General) is a learning system that derives general rules from specific examples. SG learns incrementally with good speed and generalization. The SG network is built of many simple nodes that adapt to the problem being learned. Learning is done without requiring user adjustment of sensitive parameters and noise is tolerated with graceful degradation in performance. Nodes learn important features in the input space and then monitor the ability of the features to predict output values. Learning is O(n log n) for each example, where n is the number of nodes in the network, and the number of inputs and output values are treated as constants. An enhanced network topology reduces time complexity to O(log n). Empirical results show that the model gives good generalization and that learning converges in a small number of training passes. ",0
"Title: Stochastic search in inductive concept learning  
Abstract: Concept learning can be viewed as search of the space of concept descriptions. The hypothesis language determines the search space. In standard inductive learning algorithms, the structure of the search space is determined by generalization/specialization operators. Algorithms perform locally optimal search by using a hill-climbing and/or a beam-search strategy. To overcome this limitation, concept learning can be viewed as stochastic search of the space of concept descriptions. The proposed stochastic search method is based on simulated annealing which is known as a successful means for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The stochastic search method, implemented in a rule learning system ATRIS, is based on a compact and efficient representation of the problem and the appropriate operators for structuring the search space. Furthermore, by heuristic pruning of the search space, the method enables also handling of imperfect data. The paper introduces the stochastic search method, describes the ATRIS learning algorithm and gives results of the experiments.

Abstract: Much recent research in decision theoretic planning has adopted Markov decision processes (MDPs) as the model of choice, and has attempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure. One particular algorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression, using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The algorithm as presented is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects. We describe a new decision theoretic regression operator that corrects this weakness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach.",0
"Title: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: For many types of learners one can compute the statistically ""optimal"" way to select data.

We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regres sion are both efficient and accurate.","Title: Learning Team Strategies With Multiple Policy-Sharing Agents: A Soccer Case Study  
Abstract: We use simulated soccer to study multiagent learning. Each team's players (agents) share action set and policy but may behave differently due to position-dependent inputs. All agents making up a team are rewarded or punished collectively in case of goals. We conduct simulations with varying team sizes, and compare two learning algorithms: TD-Q learning with linear neural networks (TD-Q) and Probabilistic Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE). TD-Q is based on evaluation functions (EFs) mapping input/action pairs to expected reward, while PIPE searches policy space directly. PIPE uses adaptive ""probabilistic prototype trees"" to synthesize programs that calculate action probabilities from current inputs. Our results show that TD-Q encounters several difficulties in learning appropriate shared EFs. PIPE, however, does not depend on EFs and can find good policies faster and more reliably. This suggests that in multiagent learning scenarios direct search through policy space can offer advantages over EF-based approaches. ",0
"Title: Nonlinear Prediction of Chaotic Time Series Using Support Vector Machines  
Abstract: A novel method for regression has been recently proposed by V. Vapnik et al. [8, 9]. The technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), is very well founded from the mathematical point of view and seems to provide a new insight in function approximation. We implemented the SVM and tested it on the same data base of chaotic time series that was used in [1] to compare the performances of different approximation techniques, including polynomial and rational approximation, local polynomial techniques, Radial Basis Functions, and Neural Networks. The SVM performs better than the approaches presented in [1]. We also study, for a particular time series, the variability in performance with respect to the few free parameters of SVM.","Title: Parity: The Problem that Won't Go Away  
Abstract: It is well-known that certain learning methods (e.g., the perceptron learning algorithm) cannot acquire complete, parity mappings. But it is often overlooked that state-of-the-art learning methods such as C4.5 and backpropagation cannot generalise from incomplete parity mappings. The failure of such methods to generalise on parity mappings may be sometimes dismissed on the grounds that it is `impossible' to generalise over such mappings, or that parity problems are mathematical constructs having little to do with real-world learning. However, this paper argues that such a dismissal is unwarranted. It shows that parity mappings are hard to learn because they are statistically neutral and that statistical neutrality is a property which we should expect to encounter frequently in real-world contexts. It also shows that the generalization failure on parity mappings occurs even when large, minimally incomplete mappings are used for training purposes, i.e., when claims about the impossibility of generalization are particularly suspect.",0
"Title: Belief Propagation and Revision in Networks with Loops  
Abstract: Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the optimal beliefs for singly connected networks. Recently, a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same algorithms on networks with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. Here we lay a foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we prove that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revision at convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the state space. For networks with multiple loops, we introduce the concept of a ""balanced network"" and show simulation results comparing belief revision and update in such networks. We show that the Turbo code structure is balanced and present simulations on a toy Turbo code problem indicating the decoding obtained by belief revision at convergence is significantly more likely to be correct.

","Title: An Explanation-Based Approach to Improve Retrieval in Case-Based Planning  
Abstract: When a case-based planner is retrieving a previous case in preparation for solving a new similar problem, it is often not aware of the implicit features of the new problem situation which determine if a particular case may be successfully applied. This means that some cases may be retrieved in error in that the case may fail to improve the planner's performance. Retrieval may be incrementally improved by detecting and explaining these failures as they occur. In this paper we provide a definition of case failure for the planner, dersnlp (derivation replay in snlp), which solves new problems by replaying its previous plan derivations. We provide EBL (explanation-based learning) techniques for detecting and constructing the reasons for the failure. We also describe how to organize a case library so as to incorporate this failure information as it is produced. Finally we present an empirical study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in improving the performance of dersnlp.",0

The effectiveness of the encoding scheme is demonstrated in an object recognition task that requires artificial creatures (whose behaviour is driven by a neural network) to develop high-level finite-state exploration and discrimination strategies.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm, in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. ",0

","Title: SUPPRESSING RANDOM WALKS IN MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO USING ORDERED OVERRELAXATION  
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling and simple forms of the Metropolis algorithm typically move about the distribution being sampled via a random walk. For the complex, high-dimensional distributions commonly encountered in Bayesian inference and statistical physics, the distance moved in each iteration of these algorithms will usually be small, because it is difficult or impossible to transform the problem to eliminate dependencies between variables. The inefficiency inherent in taking such small steps is greatly exacerbated when the algorithm operates via a random walk, as in such a case moving to a point n steps away will typically take around n 2 iterations. Such random walks can sometimes be suppressed using ""overrelaxed"" variants of Gibbs sampling (a.k.a. the heatbath algorithm), but such methods have hitherto been largely restricted to problems where all the full conditional distributions are Gaussian. I present an overrelaxed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on order statistics that is more widely applicable. In particular, the algorithm can be applied whenever the full conditional distributions are such that their cumulative distribution functions and inverse cumulative distribution functions can be efficiently computed. The method is demonstrated on an inference problem for a simple hierarchical Bayesian model. ",0
"Title: An Introspection Approach to Querying a Trainer  
Abstract: Technical Report 96-13 January 22, 1996 Abstract This paper introduces the Introspection Approach, a method by which a learning agent employing reinforcement learning can decide when to ask a training agent for instruction. When using our approach, we find that the same number of trainer's responses produced significantly faster learners than by having the learner ask for aid randomly. Guidance received via our approach is more informative than random guidance. Thus, we can reduce the interaction that the training agent has with the learning agent without reducing the speed with which the learner develops its policy. In fact, by being intelligent about when the learner asks for help, we can even increase the learning speed for the same level of trainer interaction.

Accuracy and reliability of the probability estimates are demonstrated.","Title: Drug design by machine learning: Modelling drug activity

"Title: An Efficient Implementation of Sigmoidal Neural Nets in Temporal Coding with Noisy Spiking Neurons  
Abstract: We show that networks of relatively realistic mathematical models for biological neurons can in principle simulate arbitrary feedforward sigmoidal neural nets in a way which has previously not been considered. This new approach is based on temporal coding by single spikes (respectively by the timing of synchronous firing in pools of neurons), rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing rates. The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and hence more consistent with experimental results about the maximal speed of information processing in cortical neural systems. As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy spiking neurons are ""universal approximators"" in the sense that they can approximate with regard to temporal coding any given continuous function of several variables. This result holds for a fairly large class of schemes for coding analog variables by firing times of spiking neurons. Our new proposal for the possible organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the self-organization of such networks. Finally, our fast and noise-robust implementation of sigmoidal neural nets via temporal coding points to possible new ways of implementing feedforward and recurrent sigmoidal neural nets with pulse stream VLSI.

We compare LMDT empirically to a univariate decision tree algorithm and observe that when multivariate tests are the appropriate bias for a given data set, LMDT finds small accurate trees. ",0
"Title: A Blind Identification and Separation Technique via Multi-layer Neural Networks  
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of blind identification and source separation which consists of estimation of the mixing matrix and/or the separation of a mixture of stochastically independent sources without a priori knowledge on the mixing matrix . The method we propose here estimates the mixture matrix by a recurrent Input-Output (IO) Identification using as inputs a nonlinear transformation of the estimated sources. Herein, the nonlinear transformation (distortion) consists in constraining the modulus of the inputs of the IO-Identification device to be a constant. In contrast to other existing approaches, the covariance of the additive noise do not need to be modeled and can be estimated as a regular parameter if needed. The proposed approach is implemented using multi-layer neural networks in order to improve performance of separation. New associated on-line un-supervised adaptive learning rules are also developed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by some computer simulations. ","Title: Human Face Detection in Visual Scenes

We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.",0

Abstract: We describe the maximum-likelihood parameter estimation problem and how the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used for its solution.

We derive the update equations in fairly explicit detail but we do not prove any convergence properties. We try to emphasize intuition rather than mathematical rigor.

Abstract: Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state of the art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we examine and evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on recent results in the theory of learning Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayes classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness which are characteristic of naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches using benchmark problems from the U. C. Irvine repository, and compared them against C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper-based feature selection methods. ",0

In the linear combination scheme, soft competition on different feature sets is adopted as an automatic feature rank mechanism so that different feature sets can be always simultaneously used in an optimal way to determine linear combination weights. For training the linear combination scheme, a learning algorithm is developed based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method has been applied to a typical real world problem, viz. speaker identification, in which different feature sets often need consideration simultaneously for robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields good performance in speaker identification.",0

Our algorithms are comparable with PC [15] and IC [12, 11], which rely on conditional independence. We present the algorithms and empirical comparisons with PC and IC. ",0
"Title: Edges are the `Independent Components' of Natural Scenes.  
Abstract: Field (1994) has suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse, distributed representation of natural scenes, and Barlow (1989) has reasoned that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features. We show here that non-linear `infomax', when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes, produces sets of visual filters that are localised and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996). In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the info-max network is able to perform Independent Components Analysis (ICA). We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images.","Title: Evolutionary Learning of the Crossover Operator

"Title: VIEWNET ARCHITECTURES FOR INVARIANT 3-D OBJECT LEARNING AND RECOGNITION FROM MULTIPLE 2-D VIEWS  
Abstract: 3 The recognition of 3-D objects from sequences of their 2-D views is modeled by a family of self-organizing neural architectures, called VIEWNET, that use View Information Encoded With NETworks. VIEWNET incorporates a preprocessor that generates a compressed but 2-D invariant representation of an image, a supervised incremental learning system (Fuzzy ARTMAP) that classifies the preprocessed representations into 2-D view categories whose outputs are combined into 3-D invariant object categories, and a working memory that makes a 3-D object prediction by accumulating evidence over time from 3-D object category nodes as multiple 2-D views are experienced. VIEWNET was benchmarked on an MIT Lincoln Laboratory database of 128x128 2-D views of aircraft, including small frontal views, with and without additive noise. A recognition rate of up to 90% is achieved with one 2-D view and of up to 98.5% correct with three 2-D views. The properties of 2-D view and 3-D object category nodes are compared with those of cells in monkey inferotemporal cortex. ","Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning in Motion Planning  
Abstract: While exploring to find better solutions, an agent performing online reinforcement learning (RL) can perform worse than is acceptable. In some cases, exploration might have unsafe, or even catastrophic, results, often modeled in terms of reaching `failure' states of the agent's environment. This paper presents a method that uses domain knowledge to reduce the number of failures during exploration. This method formulates the set of actions from which the RL agent composes a control policy to ensure that exploration is conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable policies. The resulting action set has a more abstract relationship to the task being solved than is common in many applications of RL. Although the cost of this added safety is that learning may result in a suboptimal solution, we argue that this is an appropriate tradeoff in many problems. We illustrate this method in the domain of motion planning. ",0
"Title: A Genetic Algorithm for Continuous Design Space Search  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used as a means for performing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains the simple, classical implementation of a GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover is often inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. In this paper we describe a GA for continuous design-space optimization that uses new GA operators and strategies tailored to the structure and properties of engineering design domains. Empirical results in the domains of supersonic transport aircraft and supersonic missile inlets demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in both efficiency and reliability.

"Title: Neural Network Applicability: Classifying the Problem Space  
Abstract: The tremendous current effort to propose neurally inspired methods of computation forces closer scrutiny of real world application potential of these models. This paper categorizes applications into classes and particularly discusses features of applications which make them efficiently amenable to neural network methods. Computational machines do deterministic mappings of inputs to outputs and many computational mechanisms have been proposed for problem solutions. Neural network features include parallel execution, adaptive learning, generalization, and fault tolerance. Often, much effort is given to a model and applications which can already be implemented in a much more efficient way with an alternate technology. Neural networks are potentially powerful devices for many classes of applications, but not all. However, it is proposed that the class of applications for which neural networks are efficient is both large and commonly occurring in nature. Comparison of supervised, unsupervised, and generalizing systems is also included. ","Title: Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms as Heuristics for NP-Complete Problems

"Title: Learning When Reformulation is Appropriate for Iterative Design  
Abstract: It is well known that search-space reformulation can improve the speed and reliability of numerical optimization in engineering design. We argue that the best choice of reformulation depends on the design goal, and present a technique for automatically constructing rules that map the design goal into a reformulation chosen from a space of possible reformulations. We tested our technique in the domain of racing-yacht-hull design, where each reformulation corresponds to incorporating constraints into the search space. We applied a standard inductive-learning algorithm, C4.5, to a set of training data describing which constraints are active in the optimal design for each goal encountered in a previous design session. We then used these rules to choose an appropriate reformulation for each of a set of test cases. Our experimental results show that using these reformulations improves both the speed and the reliability of design optimization, outperforming competing methods and approaching the best performance possible. ","Title: ENVIRONMENT-INDEPENDENT REINFORCEMENT ACCELERATION  difference between time and space is that you can't reuse time.  
Abstract: A reinforcement learning system with limited computational resources interacts with an unrestricted, unknown environment. Its goal is to maximize cumulative reward, to be obtained throughout its limited, unknown lifetime. System policy is an arbitrary modifiable algorithm mapping environmental inputs and internal states to outputs and new internal states. The problem is: in realistic, unknown environments, each policy modification process (PMP) occurring during system life may have unpredictable influence on environmental states, rewards and PMPs at any later time. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot properly deal with this. Neither can naive exhaustive search among all policy candidates | not even in case of very small search spaces. In fact, a reasonable way of measuring performance improvements in such general (but typical) situations is missing. I define such a measure based on the novel ""reinforcement acceleration criterion"" (RAC). At a given time, RAC is satisfied if the beginning of each completed PMP that computed a currently valid policy modification has been followed by long-term acceleration of average reinforcement intake (the computation time for later PMPs is taken into account). I present a method called ""environment-independent reinforcement acceleration"" (EIRA) which is guaranteed to achieve RAC. EIRA does neither care whether the system's policy allows for changing itself, nor whether there are multiple, interacting learning systems. Consequences are: (1) a sound theoretical framework for ""meta-learning"" (because the success of a PMP recursively depends on the success of all later PMPs, for which it is setting the stage). (2) A sound theoretical framework for multi-agent learning. The principles have been implemented (1) in a single system using an assembler-like programming language to modify its own policy, and (2) a system consisting of multiple agents, where each agent is in fact just a connection in a fully recurrent reinforcement learning neural net. A by-product of this research is a general reinforcement learning algorithm for such nets. Preliminary experiments illustrate the theory. ",0
"Title: Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure  
Abstract: Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because only a fraction of the relevant information is available at any instant. Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time|e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase|but not structure that occurs over longer time periods|e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard Many patterns in the world are intrinsically temporal, e.g., speech, music, the unfolding of events. Recurrent neural net architectures have been devised to accommodate time-varying sequences. For example, the architecture shown in Figure 1 can map a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs. Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult computational problem because the input pattern may not contain all the task-relevant information at any instant. Thus, back propagation.","Title: Stochastic simulation algorithms for dynamic probabilistic networks  
Abstract: Stochastic simulation algorithms such as likelihood weighting often give fast, accurate approximations to posterior probabilities in probabilistic networks, and are the methods of choice for very large networks. Unfortunately, the special characteristics of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs), which are used to represent stochastic temporal processes, mean that standard simulation algorithms perform very poorly. In essence, the simulation trials diverge further and further from reality as the process is observed over time. In this paper, we present simulation algorithms that use the evidence observed at each time step to push the set of trials back towards reality. The first algorithm, ""evidence reversal"" (ER) restructures each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes for the slice become ancestors of the state variables. The second algorithm, called ""survival of the fittest"" sampling (SOF), ""repopulates"" the set of trials at each time step using a stochastic reproduction rate weighted by the likelihood of the evidence according to each trial. We compare the performance of each algorithm with likelihood weighting on the original network, and also investigate the benefits of combining the ER and SOF methods. The ER/SOF combination appears to maintain bounded error independent of the number of time steps in the simulation.",0
"Title: Plasticity in cortical neuron properties: Modeling the effects of an NMDA antagonist and a GABA
Abstract: Infusion of a GABA agonist (Reiter & Stryker, 1988) and infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist (Bear et al., 1990), in the primary visual cortex of kittens during monocular deprivation, shifts ocular dominance toward the closed eye, in the cortical region near the infusion site. This reverse ocular dominance shift has been previously modeled by variants of a covariance synaptic plasticity rule (Bear et al., 1990; Clothiaux et al., 1991; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988). Kasamatsu et al. (1997, 1998) showed that infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist in adult cat primary visual cortex changes ocular dominance distribution, reduces binocularity, and reduces orientation and direction selectivity. This paper presents a novel account of the effects of these pharmacological treatments, based on the EXIN synaptic plasticity rules (Marshall, 1995), which include both an instar afferent excitatory and an outstar lateral inhibitory rule. Functionally, the EXIN plasticity rules enhance the efficiency, discrimination, and context-sensitivity of a neural network's representation of perceptual patterns (Marshall, 1995; Marshall & Gupta, 1998). The EXIN model decreases lateral inhibition from neurons outside the infusion site (control regions) to neurons inside the infusion region, during monocular deprivation. In the model, plasticity in afferent pathways to neurons affected by the pharmacological treatments is assumed to be blocked , as opposed to previous models (Bear et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988), in which afferent pathways from the open eye to neurons in the infusion region are weakened . The proposed model is consistent with results suggesting that long-term plasticity can be blocked by NMDA antagonists or by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (Bear et al., 1990; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Goda & Stevens, 1996; Kirkwood et al., 1993). Since the role of plasticity in lateral inhibitory pathways in producing cortical plasticity has not received much attention, several predictions are made based on the EXIN lateral inhibitory plasticity rule.

Abstract: Default logic encounters some conceptual difficulties in representing common sense reasoning tasks. We argue that we should not try to formulate modular default rules that are presumed to work in all or most circumstances. We need to take into account the importance of the context which is continuously evolving during the reasoning process. Sequential thresholding is a quantitative counterpart of default logic which makes explicit the role context plays in the construction of a non-monotonic extension. We present a semantic characterization of generic non-monotonic reasoning, as well as the instan-tiations pertaining to default logic and sequential thresholding. This provides a link between the two mechanisms as well as a way to integrate the two that can be beneficial to both.","Title: Introduction to Radial Basis Function Networks

"Title: On the Effectiveness of Evolutionary Search in High-Dimensional NK-Landscapes  
Abstract: NK-landscapes offer the ability to assess the performance of evolutionary algorithms on problems with different degrees of epistasis. In this paper, we study the performance of six algorithms in NK-landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant. The results show that compared to genetic local search algorithms, the performance of standard genetic algorithms employing crossover or mutation significantly decreases with increasing problem size. Furthermore, with increasing K, crossover based algorithms are in both cases outperformed by mutation based algorithms. However, the relative performance differences between the algorithms grow significantly with the dimension of the search space, indicating that it is important to consider high-dimensional landscapes for evaluating the performance of evolutionary algorithms. ","Title: Randomly Fallible Teachers: Learning Monotone DNF with an Incomplete Membership Oracle  
Abstract: We introduce a new fault-tolerant model of algorithmic learning using an equivalence oracle and an incomplete membership oracle, in which the answers to a random subset of the learner's membership queries may be missing. We demonstrate that, with high probability, it is still possible to learn monotone DNF formulas in polynomial time, provided that the fraction of missing answers is bounded by some constant less than one. Even when half the membership queries are expected to yield no information, our algorithm will exactly identify m-term, n-variable monotone DNF formulas with an expected O(mn 2 ) queries. The same task has been shown to require exponential time using equivalence queries alone. We extend the algorithm to handle some one-sided errors, and discuss several other possible error models. It is hoped that this work may lead to a better understanding of the power of membership queries and the effects of faulty teachers on query models of concept learning. ",0

We extend this work to domains where the agent must order and achieve a sequence of subgoals in an optimal fashion. Hierarchical EBRL can effectively learn optimal policies in some of these sequential task domains even when the subgoals weakly interact with each other. We also show that when a planner that can achieve the individual subgoals is available, our method converges even faster. ","Title: Factor Graphs and Algorithms

"Title: Extending Theory Refinement to M-of-N Rules  
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning research has started addressing a problem known as theory refinement. The goal of a theory refinement learner is to modify an incomplete or incorrect rule base, representing a domain theory, to make it consistent with a set of input training examples. This paper presents a major revision of the Either propositional theory refinement system. Two issues are discussed. First, we show how run time efficiency can be greatly improved by changing from a exhaustive scheme for computing repairs to an iterative greedy method. Second, we show how to extend Either to refine M-of-N rules. The resulting algorithm, Neither (New Either), is more than an order of magnitude faster and produces significantly more accurate results with theories that fit the M-of-N format. To demonstrate the advantages of Neither, we present experimental results from two real-world domains. ","Title: Structural Similarity and Adaptation  
Abstract: Most commonly, case-based reasoning is applied in domains where attribute value representations of cases are sufficient to represent the features relevant to support classification, diagnosis or design tasks. Distance functions like the Hamming-distance or their transformation into similarity functions are applied to retrieve past cases to be used to generate the solution of an actual problem. Often, domain knowledge is available to adapt past solutions to new problems or to evaluate solutions. However, there are domains like architectural design or law in which structural case representations and corresponding structural similarity functions are needed. Often, the acquisition of adaptation knowledge seems to be impossible or rather requires an effort that is not manageable for fielded applications. Despite of this, humans use cases as the main source to generate adapted solutions. How to achieve this computationally? This paper presents a general approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation. The approach allows to explore structural case representations and limited domain knowledge to support design tasks. It is exemplarily instantiated in three modules of the design assistant FABEL-Idea that generates adapted design solutions on the basis of prior CAD layouts.",0

"Title: Problem Formulation, Program Synthesis and Program Transformation Techniques for Simulation, Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction (Research Statement)  
Abstract: A parallel version is proposed for a fundamental theorem of serial unconstrained optimization. The parallel theorem allows each of k parallel processors to use simultaneously a different algorithm, such as a descent, Newton, quasi-Newton or a conjugate gradient algorithm. Each processor can perform one or many steps of a serial algorithm on a portion of the gradient of the objective function assigned to it, independently of the other processors. Eventually a synchronization step is performed which, for differentiable convex functions, consists of taking a strong convex combination of the k points found by the k processors. For nonconvex, as well as convex, differentiable functions, the best point found by the k processors is taken, or any better point. The fundamental result that we establish is that any accumulation point of the parallel algorithm is stationary for the nonconvex case, and is a global solution for the convex case. Computational testing on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor indicate a speedup of the order of the number of processors employed.

"Title: Adapting Crossover in Evolutionary Algorithms  
Abstract: One of the issues in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is the relative importance of two search operators: mutation and crossover. Genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP) stress the role of crossover, while evolutionary programming (EP) and evolution strategies (ESs) stress the role of mutation. The existence of many different forms of crossover further complicates the issue. Despite theoretical analysis, it appears difficult to decide a priori which form of crossover to use, or even if crossover should be used at all. One possible solution to this difficulty is to have the EA be self-adaptive, i.e., to have the EA dynamically modify which forms of crossover to use and how often to use them, as it solves a problem. This paper describes an adaptive mechanism for controlling the use of crossover in an EA and explores the behavior of this mechanism in a number of different situations. An improvement to the adaptive mechanism is then presented. Surprisingly this improvement can also be used to enhance performance in a non-adaptive EA.

We propose a theoretical complexity analysis coupled with some experimental tests, intended to evaluate the adequacy of adaptation strategies which re-use the solutions of past diagnostic problems in order to build a solution to the problem to be solved. Results of such analysis show that, even if diagnosis re-use falls into the same complexity class of diagnosis generation (they are both NP-complete problems), practical advantages can be obtained by exploiting a hybrid architecture combining case-based and model-based diagnostic problem solving in a unifying framework.

When using our approach, we find that the same number of trainer's responses produced significantly faster learners than by having the learner ask for aid randomly. Guidance received via our approach is more informative than random guidance. Thus, we can reduce the interaction that the training agent has with the learning agent without reducing the speed with which the learner develops its policy. In fact, by being intelligent about when the learner asks for help, we can even increase the learning speed for the same level of trainer interaction. ",0

Abstract: We investigate the generation of neural networks through the induction of binary trees of threshold logic units (TLUs). Initially, we describe the framework for our tree construction algorithm and how such trees can be transformed into an isomorphic neural network topology. Several methods for learning the linear discriminant functions at each node of the tree structure are examined and shown to produce accuracy results that are comparable to classical information theoretic methods for constructing decision trees (which use single feature tests at each node). Our TLU trees, however, are smaller and thus easier to understand. Moreover, we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn both the topology and weight settings of a neural network simply using the training data set that we are given. ","Title: A Model of Invariant Object Recognition in the Visual System  
Abstract: Neurons in the ventral stream of the primate visual system exhibit responses to the images of objects which are invariant with respect to natural transformations such as translation, size, and view. Anatomical and neurophysiological evidence suggests that this is achieved through a series of hierarchical processing areas. In an attempt to elucidate the manner in which such representations are established, we have constructed a model of cortical visual processing which seeks to parallel many features of this system, specifically the multi-stage hierarchy with its topologically constrained convergent connectivity. Each stage is constructed as a competitive network utilising a modified Hebb-like learning rule, called the trace rule, which incorporates previous as well as current neuronal activity. The trace rule enables neurons to learn about whatever is invariant over short time periods (e.g. 0.5 s) in the representation of objects as the objects transform in the real world. The trace rule enables neurons to learn the statistical invariances about objects during their transformations, by associating together representations which occur close together in time. We show that by using the trace rule training algorithm the model can indeed learn to produce transformation invariant responses to natural stimuli such as faces.",0
"Title: Decomposable graphical Gaussian model determination  
Abstract: We propose a methodology for Bayesian model determination in decomposable graphical Gaussian models. To achieve this aim we consider a hyper inverse Wishart prior distribution on the concentration matrix for each given graph. To ensure compatibility across models, such prior distributions are obtained by marginalisation from the prior conditional on the complete graph. We explore alternative structures for the hyperparameters of the latter, and their consequences for the model. Model determination is carried out by implementing a reversible jump MCMC sampler. In particular, the dimension-changing move we propose involves adding or dropping an edge from the graph. We characterise the set of moves which preserve the decomposability of the graph, giving a fast algorithm for maintaining the junction tree representation of the graph at each sweep. As state variable, we propose to use the incomplete variance-covariance matrix, containing only the elements for which the corresponding element of the inverse is nonzero. This allows all computations to be performed locally, at the clique level, which is a clear advantage for the analysis of large and complex data-sets. Finally, the statistical and computational performance of the procedure is illustrated by means of both artificial and real multidimensional data-sets.

"Title: Grounding Robotic Control with Genetic Neural Networks  
Abstract: Technical Report AI94-223 May 1994 Abstract An important but often neglected problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence is that of grounding systems in their environment such that the representations they manipulate have inherent meaning for the system. Since humans rely so heavily on semantics, it seems likely that the grounding is crucial to the development of truly intelligent behavior. This study investigates the use of simulated robotic agents with neural network processors as part of a method to ensure grounding. Both the topology and weights of the neural networks are optimized through genetic algorithms. Although such comprehensive optimization is difficult, the empirical evidence gathered here shows that the method is not only tractable but quite fruitful. In the experiments, the agents evolved a wall-following control strategy and were able to transfer it to novel environments. Their behavior suggests that they were also learning to build cognitive maps. ","Title: Interpolation Models with Multiple

The ratio ff=fi alone is responsible for determining globally all these attributes of the interpolant: its `complexity', `flexibility', `smoothness', `characteristic scale length', and `characteristic amplitude'. We suggest that interpolation models should be able to capture more than just one flavour of simplicity and complexity. We describe Bayesian models in which the interpolant has a smoothness that varies spatially. We emphasize the importance, in practical implementation, of the concept of `conditional convexity' when designing models with many hyperparameters. We apply the new models to the interpolation of neuronal spike data and demonstrate a substantial improvement in generalization error. ",0
"Title: Self-Organization and Functional Role of Lateral Connections and Multisize Receptive Fields in the Primary Visual Cortex  
Abstract: Cells in the visual cortex are selective not only to ocular dominance and orientation of the input, but also to its size and spatial frequency. The simulations reported in this paper show how size selectivity could develop through Hebbian self-organization, and how receptive fields of different sizes could organize into columns like those for orientation and ocular dominance. The lateral connections in the network self-organize cooperatively and simultaneously with the receptive field sizes, and produce patterns of lateral connectivity that closely follow the receptive field organization. Together with our previous work on ocular dominance and orientation selectivity, these results suggest that a single Hebbian self-organizing process can give rise to all the major receptive field properties in the visual cortex, and also to structured patterns of lateral interactions, some of which have been verified experimentally and others predicted by the model. The model also suggests a functional role for the self-organized structures: The afferent receptive fields develop a sparse coding of the visual input, and the recurrent lateral interactions eliminate redundancies in cortical activity patterns, allowing the cortex to efficiently process massive amounts of visual information. ","Title: Genetic Programming and Data Structures  
Abstract: We attempt to recover an unknown function from noisy, sampled data. Using orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets we develop a nonlinear method which works in the wavelet domain by simple nonlinear shrinkage of the empirical wavelet coefficients. The shrinkage can be tuned to be nearly minimax over any member of a wide range of Triebel- and Besov-type smoothness constraints, and asymptotically minimax over Besov bodies with p q. Linear estimates cannot achieve even the minimax rates over Triebel and Besov classes with p &lt; 2, so our method can significantly outperform every linear method (kernel, smoothing spline, sieve, : : : ) in a minimax sense. Variants of our method based on simple threshold nonlinearities are nearly minimax. Our method possesses the interpretation of spatial adaptivity: it reconstructs using a kernel which may vary in shape and bandwidth from point to point, depending on the data. Least favorable distributions for certain of the Triebel and Besov scales generate objects with sparse wavelet transforms. Many real objects have similarly sparse transforms, which suggests that these minimax results are relevant for practical problems. Sequels to this paper discuss practical implementation, spatial adaptation properties and applications to inverse problems. Acknowledgements.

"Title: Game Theory, On-line Prediction and Boosting  
Abstract: We study the close connections between game theory, on-line prediction and boosting. After a brief review of game theory, we describe an algorithm for learning to play repeated games based on the on-line prediction methods of Littlestone and War-muth. The analysis of this algorithm yields a simple proof of von Neumann's famous minmax theorem, as well as a provable method of approximately solving a game. We then show that the on-line prediction model is obtained by applying this game-playing algorithm to an appropriate choice of game and that boosting is obtained by applying the same algorithm to the dual of this game.","Title: Strategy Learning with Multilayer Connectionist Representations 1  
Abstract: Results are presented that demonstrate the learning and fine-tuning of search strategies using connectionist mechanisms. Previous studies of strategy learning within the symbolic, production-rule formalism have not addressed fine-tuning behavior. Here a two-layer connectionist system is presented that develops its search from a weak to a task-specific strategy and fine-tunes its performance. The system is applied to a simulated, real-time, balance-control task. We compare the performance of one-layer and two-layer networks, showing that the ability of the two-layer network to discover new features and thus enhance the original representation is critical to solving the balancing task.

"Title: Malicious Membership Queries and Exceptions  
Abstract: Evaluation of counterfactual queries (e.g., ""If A were true, would C have been true?"") is important to fault diagnosis, planning, determination of liability, and policy analysis. We present a method for evaluating counter-factuals when the underlying causal model is represented by structural models a nonlinear generalization of the simultaneous equations models commonly used in econometrics and social sciences. This new method provides a coherent means for evaluating policies involving the control of variables which, prior to enacting the policy were influenced by other variables in the system. ","Title: A THEORY OF LEARNING CLASSIFICATION RULES  
Abstract: This chapter takes a different standpoint to address the problem of learning. We will here reason only in terms of probability, and make extensive use of the chain rule known as ""Bayes' rule"". A fast definition of the basics in probability is provided in appendix A for quick reference. Most of this chapter is a review of the methods of Bayesian learning applied to our modelling purposes. Some original analyses and comments are also provided in section 5.8, 5.11 and 5.12. There is a latent rivalry between ""Bayesian"" and ""Orthodox"" statistics. It is by no means our intention to enter this kind of controversy. We are perfectly willing to accept orthodox as well as unorthodox methods, as long as they are scientifically sound and provide good results when applied to learning tasks. The same disclaimer applies to the two frameworks presented here. They have been the object of heated controversy in the past 3 years in the neural networks community. We will not take side, but only present both frameworks, with their strong points and their weaknesses. In the context of this work, the ""Bayesian frameworks"" are especially interesting as the provide some continuous update rules that can be used during regularised cost minimisation to yield an automatic selection of the regularisation level. Unlike the methods presented in chapter 3, it is not necessary to try several regularisation levels and perform as many optimisations. The Bayesian framework is the only one in which training is achieved through a one-pass optimisation procedure. ",0

Abstract: MIT Computational Cognitive Science Technical Report 9604 Abstract We develop a recursive node-elimination formalism for efficiently approximating large probabilistic networks. No constraints are set on the network topologies. Yet the formalism can be straightforwardly integrated with exact methods whenever they are/become applicable. The approximations we use are controlled: they maintain consistently upper and lower bounds on the desired quantities at all times. We show that Boltzmann machines, sigmoid belief networks, or any combination (i.e., chain graphs) can be handled within the same framework.

Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) has been successfully used to assist in case retrieval tasks. However, behavioral limitations of CCBR motivate the search for integrations with other reasoning approaches. This paper briefly describes our group's ongoing efforts towards enhancing the inferencing behaviors of a conversational case-based reasoning development tool named NaCoDAE. In particular, we focus on integrating NaCoDAE with machine learning, model-based reasoning, and generative planning modules. This paper defines CCBR, briefly summarizes the integrations, and explains how they enhance the overall system. Our research focuses on enhancing the performance of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems (Aha & Breslow, 1997). CCBR is a form of case-based reasoning where users initiate problem solving conversations by entering an initial problem description in natural language text. This text is assumed to be a partial rather than a complete problem description. The CCBR system then assists in eliciting refinements of this description and in suggesting solutions. Its primary purpose is to provide a focus of attention for the user so as to quickly provide a solution(s) for their problem. Figure 1 summarizes the CCBR problem solving cycle. Cases in a CCBR library have three components: ",0
"Title: The Gamma MLP for Speech Phoneme Recognition  
Abstract: We define a Gamma multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as an MLP with the usual synaptic weights replaced by gamma filters (as proposed by de Vries and Principe (de Vries & Principe 1992)) and associated gain terms throughout all layers. We derive gradient descent update equations and apply the model to the recognition of speech phonemes. We find that both the inclusion of gamma filters in all layers, and the inclusion of synaptic gains, improves the performance of the Gamma MLP. We compare the Gamma MLP with TDNN, Back-Tsoi FIR MLP, and Back-Tsoi IIR MLP architectures, and a local approximation scheme. We find that the Gamma MLP results in a substantial reduction in error rates. ","Title: Price's Theorem and the MAX Problem  
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the evolution of GP populations using the problem of finding a program which returns the maximum possible value for a given terminal and function set and a depth limit on the program tree (known as the MAX problem). We confirm the basic message of [ Gathercole and Ross, 1996 ] that crossover together with program size restrictions can be responsible for premature convergence to a sub-optimal solution. We show that this can happen even when the population retains a high level of variety and show that in many cases evolution from the sub-optimal solution to the solution is possible if sufficient time is allowed. In both cases theoretical models are presented and compared with actual runs. Experimental evidence is presented that Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem can be applied to GP populations and the practical effect of program size restrictions are noted. Finally we show that covariance between gene frequency and fitness in the first few generations can be used to predict the course of GP runs.",0
"Title: A Genetic Algorithm for Continuous Design Space Search  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used as a means for performing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains the simple, classical implementation of a GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover is often inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. In this paper we describe a GA for continuous design-space optimization that uses new GA operators and strategies tailored to the structure and properties of engineering design domains. Empirical results in the domains of supersonic transport aircraft and supersonic missile inlets demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in both efficiency and reliability. ","Title: A DISCUSSION ON SOME DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR EFFICIENT CROSSOVER OPERATORS FOR GRAPH COLORING PROBLEMS  
Abstract: A year ago, a new metaheuristic for graph coloring problems was introduced by Costa, Hertz and Dubuis. They have shown, with computer experiments, some clear indication of the benefits of this approach. Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling. The metaheuristic can be classified as a memetic algorithm since it is based on a population search in which periods of local optimization are interspersed with phases in which new configurations are created from earlier well-developed configurations or local minima of the previous iterative improvement process. The new population is created using crossover operators as in genetic algorithms. In this paper we discuss how a methodology inspired in Competitive Analysis may be relevant to the problem of designing better crossover operators.

"Title: MCMC CONVERGENCE DIAGNOSTIC VIA THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM  
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as introduced by Gelfand and Smith (1990), provide a simulation based strategy for statistical inference. The application fields related to these methods, as well as theoretical convergence properties, have been intensively studied in the recent literature. However, many improvements are still expected to provide workable and theoretically well-grounded solutions to the problem of monitoring the convergence of actual outputs from MCMC algorithms (i.e. the convergence assessment problem). In this paper, we introduce and discuss a methodology based on the Central Limit Theorem for Markov chains to assess convergence of MCMC algorithms. Instead of searching for approximate stationarity, we primarily intend to control the precision of estimates of the invariant probability measure, or of integrals of functions with respect to this measure, through confidence regions based on normal approximation. The first proposed control method tests the normality hypothesis for normalized averages of functions of the Markov chain over independent parallel chains. This normality control provides good guarantees that the whole state space has been explored, even in multimodal situations. It can lead to automated stopping rules. A second tool connected with the normality control is based on graphical monitoring of the stabilization of the variance after n iterations near the limiting variance appearing in the CLT. Both methods require no knowledge of the sampler driving the chain. In this paper, we mainly focus on finite state Markov chains, since this setting allows us to derive consistent estimates of both the limiting variance and the variance after n iterations. Heuristic procedures based on Berry-Esseen bounds are investigated. An extension to the continuous case is also proposed. Numerical simulations illustrating the performance of these methods are given for several examples: a finite chain with multimodal invariant probability, a finite state random walk for which the theoretical rate of convergence to stationarity is known, and a continuous state chain with multimodal invariant probability issued from a Gibbs sampler. ","Title: Finding Overlapping Distributions with MML  
Abstract: This paper considers an aspect of mixture modelling. Significantly overlapping distributions require more data for their parameters to be accurately estimated than well separated distributions. For example, two Gaussian distributions are considered to significantly overlap when their means are within three standard deviations of each other. If insufficient data is available, only a single component distribution will be estimated, although the data originates from two component distributions. We consider how much data is required to distinguish two component distributions from one distribution in mixture modelling using the minimum message length (MML) criterion. First, we perform experiments which show the MML criterion performs well relative to other Bayesian criteria. Second, we make two improvements to the existing MML estimates, that improve its performance with overlapping distributions. ",0
"Title: Some Comments on the Information Stored in Sparse Distributed Memory  
Abstract: Report R95:11 ISRN : SICS-R--95/11-SE ISSN : 0283-3638 Abstract We consider a sparse distributed memory with randomly chosen hard locations, in which an unknown number T of random data vectors have been stored. A method is given to estimate T from the content of the memory with high accuracy. In fact, our estimate is unbiased, the coefficient of variation being roughly inversely proportional to p MU , where M is the number of hard locations in the memory and U the length of data, so the accuracy can be made arbitrarily high by making the memory big enough. A consequence of this is that the good reading methods in [5] and [6] can be used without any need for the special extra location introduced there.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of model selection in the setting of supervised learning of boolean functions from independent random examples. More precisely, we compare methods for finding a balance between the complexity of the hypothesis chosen and its observed error on a random training sample of limited size, when the goal is that of minimizing the resulting generalization error. We undertake a detailed comparison of three well-known model selection methods | a variation of Vapnik's Guaranteed Risk Minimization (GRM), an instance of Rissanen's Minimum Description Length Principle (MDL), and cross validation (CV). We introduce a general class of model selection methods (called penalty-based methods) that includes both GRM and MDL, and provide general methods for analyzing such rules. We provide both controlled experimental evidence and formal theorems to support the following conclusions: * The class of penalty-based methods is fundamentally handicapped in the sense that there exist two types of model selection problems for which every penalty-based method must incur large generalization error on at least one, while CV enjoys small generalization error Despite the inescapable incomparability of model selection methods under certain circumstances, we conclude with a discussion of our belief that the balance of the evidence provides specific reasons to prefer CV to other methods, unless one is in possession of detailed problem-specific information. on both.","Title: The Automatic Programming of Agents that Learn Mental Models and Create Simple Plans of Action  
Abstract: An essential component of an intelligent agent is the ability to notice, encode, store, and utilize information about its environment. Traditional approaches to program induction have focused on evolving functional or reactive programs. This paper presents MAPMAKER, an approach to the automatic generation of agents that discover information about their environment, encode this information for later use, and create simple plans utilizing the stored mental models. In this approach, agents are multipart computer programs that communicate through a shared memory. Both the programs and the representation scheme are evolved using genetic programming. An illustrative problem of 'gold' collection is used to demonstrate the approach in which one part of a program makes a map of the world and stores it in memory, and the other part uses this map to find the gold The results indicate that the approach can evolve programs that store simple representations of their environments and use these representations to produce simple plans. 1.

"Title: The Role of Development in Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: Technical Report Number CS94-394 Computer Science and Engineering, U.C.S.D. Abstract The developmental mechanisms transforming genotypic to phenotypic forms are typically omitted in formulations of genetic algorithms (GAs) in which these two representational spaces are identical. We argue that a careful analysis of developmental mechanisms is useful when understanding the success of several standard GA techniques, and can clarify the relationships between more recently proposed enhancements. We provide a framework which distinguishes between two developmental mechanisms | learning and maturation | while also showing several common effects on GA search. This framework is used to analyze how maturation and local search can change the dynamics of the GA. We observe that in some contexts, maturation and local search can be incorporated into the fitness evaluation, but illustrate reasons for considering them seperately. Further, we identify contexts in which maturation and local search can be distinguished from the fitness evaluation.

This corresponds to the flexible ""case completion"" approach. Flexibility is also needed for the expert view with predominant interest in the unexpected, unpredictible cases. ",0
"Title: Generative Learning Structures and Processes for Generalized Connectionist Networks  
Abstract: Massively parallel networks of relatively simple computing elements offer an attractive and versatile framework for exploring a variety of learning structures and processes for intelligent systems. This paper briefly summarizes some popular learning structures and processes used in such networks. It outlines a range of potentially more powerful alternatives for pattern-directed inductive learning in such systems. It motivates and develops a class of new learning algorithms for massively parallel networks of simple computing elements. We call this class of learning processes generative for they offer a set of mechanisms for constructive and adaptive determination of the network architecture the number of processing elements and the connectivity among them as a function of experience. Generative learning algorithms attempt to overcome some of the limitations of some approaches to learning in networks that rely on modification of weights on the links within an otherwise fixed network topology e.g., rather slow learning and the need for an a-priori choice of a network architecture. Several alternative designs as well as a range of control structures and processes which can be used to regulate the form and content of internal representations learned by such networks are examined. Empirical results from the study of some generative learning algorithms are briefly summarized and several extensions and refinements of such algorithms, and directions for future research are outlined.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of graphs as a mathematical tool for expressing independencies, and as a formal language for communicating and processing causal information for decision analysis. We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the theory of Bayesian networks and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. As an example, we show how the effect of smoking on lung cancer can be quantified from non-experimental data, using a minimal set of qualitative assumptions. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation. We exemplify the tradeoffs between the two approaches by deriving nonparametric bounds on treatment effects under conditions of imperfect compliance. fl Portions of this paper were presented at the 49th Session of the International Statistical Institute, Florence, Italy, August 25 - September 3, 1993.

"Title: A Competitive Approach to Game Learning  
Abstract: Machine learning of game strategies has often depended on competitive methods that continually develop new strategies capable of defeating previous ones. We use a very inclusive definition of game and consider a framework within which a competitive algorithm makes repeated use of a strategy learning component that can learn strategies which defeat a given set of opponents. We describe game learning in terms of sets H and X of first and second player strategies, and connect the model with more familiar models of concept learning. We show the importance of the ideas of teaching set [20] and specification number [19] k in this new context. The performance of several competitive algorithms is investigated, using both worst-case and randomized strategy learning algorithms. Our central result (Theorem 4) is a competitive algorithm that solves games in a total number of strategies polynomial in lg(jHj), lg(jX j), and k. Its use is demonstrated, including an application in concept learning with a new kind of counterexample oracle. We conclude with a complexity analysis of game learning, and list a number of new questions arising from this work. ","Title: Models of perceptual learning in vernier hyperacuity  
Abstract: Performance of human subjects in a wide variety of early visual processing tasks improves with practice. HyperBF networks (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) constitute a mathematically well-founded framework for understanding such improvement in performance, or perceptual learning, in the class of tasks known as visual hyperacuity. The present article concentrates on two issues raised by the recent psychophysical and computational findings reported in (Poggio et al., 1992b; Fahle and Edelman, 1992). First, we develop a biologically plausible extension of the HyperBF model that takes into account basic features of the functional architecture of early vision. Second, we explore various learning modes that can coexist within the HyperBF framework and focus on two unsupervised learning rules which may be involved in hyperacuity learning. Finally, we report results of psychophysical experiments that are consistent with the hypothesis that activity-dependent presynaptic amplification may be involved in perceptual learning in hyperacuity.

"Title: Planning Medical Therapy Using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes.  
Abstract: Diagnosis of a disease and its treatment are not separate, one-shot activities. Instead they are very often dependent and interleaved over time, mostly due to uncertainty about the underlying disease, uncertainty associated with the response of a patient to the treatment and varying cost of different treatment and diagnostic (investigative) procedures. The framework particularly suitable for modeling such a complex therapy decision process is Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Unfortunately the problem of finding the optimal therapy within the standard POMDP framework is also computationally very costly. In this paper we investigate various structural extensions of the standard POMDP framework and approximation methods which allow us to simplify model construction process for larger therapy problems and to solve them faster. A therapy problem we target specifically is the management of patients with ischemic heart disease. ","Title: Dynamic Hill Climbing: Overcoming the limita- tions of optimization techniques  
Abstract: This paper describes a novel search algorithm, called dynamic hill climbing, that borrows ideas from genetic algorithms and hill climbing techniques. Unlike both genetic and hill climbing algorithms, dynamic hill climbing has the ability to dynamically change its coordinate frame during the course of an optimization. Furthermore, the algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate and uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space. Dynamic hill climbing is empirically compared to a traditional genetic algorithm using De Jong's well-known five function test suite [4] and is shown to vastly surpass the performance of the genetic algorithm, often finding better solutions using only 1% as many function evaluations.

Abstract: Knowledge acquisition is a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task. The task of automatically improving an existing knowledge base using learning methods is addressed by the class of systems performing theory refinement. This paper presents a system, Forte (First-Order Revision of Theories from Examples), which refines first-order Horn-clause theories by integrating a variety of different revision techniques into a coherent whole. Forte uses these techniques within a hill-climbing framework, guided by a global heuristic. It identifies possible errors in the theory and calls on a library of operators to develop possible revisions. The best revision is implemented, and the process repeats until no further revisions are possible. Operators are drawn from a variety of sources, including propositional theory refinement, first-order induction, and inverse resolution. Forte is demonstrated in several domains, including logic programming and qualitative modelling. ",0

Abstract: subsumption is a decidable but incomplete approximation of logic implication, important to inductive logic programming and theorem proving. We show that by context based elimination of possible matches a certain superset of the determinate clauses can be tested for subsumption in polynomial time. We discuss the relation between subsumption and the clique problem, showing in particular that using additional prior knowledge about the substitution space only a small fraction of the search space can be identified as possibly containing globally consistent solutions, which leads to an effective pruning rule. We present empirical results, demonstrating that a combination of both of the above approaches provides an extreme reduction of computational effort.","Title: Learning Analytically and Inductively  
Abstract: Learning is a fundamental component of intelligence, and a key consideration in designing cognitive architectures such as Soar [ Laird et al., 1986 ] . This chapter considers the question of what constitutes an appropriate general-purpose learning mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that might explain and reproduce the rich variety of learning capabilities of humans, ranging from learning perceptual-motor skills such as how to ride a bicycle, to learning highly cognitive tasks such as how to play chess. Research on learning in fields such as cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, and statistics has led to the identification of two distinct classes of learning methods: inductive and analytic. Inductive methods, such as neural network Backpropagation, learn general laws by finding statistical correlations and regularities among a large set of training examples. In contrast, analytical methods, such as Explanation-Based Learning, acquire general laws from many fewer training examples. They rely instead on prior knowledge to analyze individual training examples in detail, then use this analysis to distinguish relevant example features from the irrelevant. The question considered in this chapter is how to best combine inductive and analytical learning in an architecture that seeks to cover the range of learning exhibited by intelligent systems such as humans. We present a specific learning mechanism, Explanation Based Neural Network learning (EBNN), that blends these two types of learning, and present experimental results demonstrating its ability to learn control strategies for a mobile robot using ",0

Abstract Existing proofs demonstrating the computational limitations of the Recurrent Cascade Correlation (RCC) Network (Fahlman, 1991) explicitly limit their results to units having sigmoidal or hard-threshold transfer functions (Giles et al., 1995; and Kremer, 1996). The proof given here shows that, for any given finite, discrete, deterministic transfer function used by the units of an RCC network, there are finite-state automata (FSA) that the network cannot model, no matter how many units are used. The proof applies equally well to continuous transfer functions with a finite number of fixed-points, such as the sigmoid function.",0
"Title: Theory-guided Empirical Speedup Learning of Goal Decomposition Rules  
Abstract: Speedup learning is the study of improving the problem-solving performance with experience and from outside guidance. We describe here a system that successfully combines the best features of Explanation-based learning and empirical learning to learn goal decomposition rules from examples of successful problem solving and membership queries. We demonstrate that our system can efficiently learn effective decomposition rules in three different domains. Our results suggest that theory-guided empirical learning can overcome the problems of purely explanation-based learning and purely empirical learning, and be an effective speedup learning method.","Title: On-Line Adaptation of a Signal Predistorter through Dual Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: Most connectionist modeling assumes noise-free inputs. This assumption is often violated. This paper introduces the idea of clearning, of simultaneously cleaning the data and learning the underlying structure. The cleaning step can be viewed as top-down processing (where the model modifies the data), and the learning step can be viewed as bottom-up processing (where the data modifies the model). Clearning is used in conjunction with standard pruning. This paper discusses the statistical foundation of clearning, gives an interpretation in terms of a mechanical model, describes how to obtain both point predictions and conditional densities for the output, and shows how the resulting model can be used to discover properties of the data otherwise not accessible (such as the signal-to-noise ratio of the inputs). This paper uses clearning to predict foreign exchange rates, a noisy time series problem with well-known benchmark performances. On the out-of-sample 1993-1994 test period, clearning obtains an annualized return on investment above 30%, significantly better than an otherwise identical network. The final ultra-sparse network with 36 remaining non-zero input-to-hidden weights (of the 1035 initial weights between 69 inputs and 15 hidden units) is very robust against overfitting. This small network also lends itself to interpretation.",0
"Title: ABSTRACTION CONSIDERED HARMFUL: LAZY LEARNING OF LANGUAGE PROCESSING  
Abstract: When m = 0 (no delays), we set A 0 (ffi) = f(j; k) ; j 6= kg, such that P m (*jffi) depends only on *. The estimated probabilities above become quite noisy when the number of elements in set A m and B m are small. For this reason, we estimate the standard deviation of P m (*jffi). Notice that this estimate is the empirical average of a binomial variable (either a given couple satisfied the conditions on ffi and *, or it does not). The standard deviation is then estimated easily by: Generally speaking, P m (*jffi) increases with * (laxer output test), and when ffi approaches 0 (stricter input condition). Let us now define by P m (*) the maximum over ffi of P m (*jffi): P m (*) = max ffi&gt;0 P m (*jffi). The dependability index is defined as: P 0 (*) represents how much data passes the continuity test when no input information is available. This dependability index measures how much of the remaining continuity information is associated with involving input i m . This index is then averaged over * with respect to the probability (1 P 0 (*)): m (*) (1 P 0 (*)) d* (4.8) It is clear that m (*), and therefore its average, should be positive quantities. Furthermore, if the system is deterministic, the dependability is zero after a certain number of inputs, so the sum of averages saturates. If the system is also noise-free, they sum up to 1. For any m greater than the embedding dimension: refers to results obtained using this method. 4.6 Statistical variable selection Statistical variable selection (or feature selection) encompasses a number of techniques aimed at choosing a relevant subset of input variables in a regression or a classification problem. As in the rest of this document, we will limit ourselves to considerations related to the regression problem, even though most methods discussed below apply to classification as well. Variable selection can be seen as a part of the data analysis problem: the selection (or discard) of a variable tells us about the relevance of the associated measurement to the modelled system. In a general setting, this is a purely combinatorial problem: given V possible variables, there is 2 V possible subsets (including the empty set and the full set) of these variables. Given a performance measure, such as prediction error, the only optimal scheme is to test all these subset and choose the one that gives the best performance. It is easy to see that such an extensive scheme is only viable when the number of variables is rather low. Identifying 2 V models when we have more than a few variables requires too much computation. A number of techniques have been devised to overcome this combinatorial limit. Some of them use an iterative, locally optimal technique to construct an estimate of the relevant subset in a number of steps. We will refer to them as stepwise selection methods, not to be con fused with stepwise regression, a subset of these methods that we will address below. In forward selection, we start with an empty set of variables. At each step, we select a candidate variable using a selection criteria, check whether this variable should be added to the set, and iterate until a given stop condition is reached. On the contrary, backward elimination methods start with the full set of all input variables. At each step, the least significant variable is selected according to a selection criteria. If this variable is irrelevant, it is removed and the process is iterated until a stop condition is reached. It is easy to devise examples where the inclusion of a variable causes a previously included variable to become irrelevant. It thus seems appropriate to consider running a backward elimination each time a new variable is added by forward selection. This combination of both ap proaches is known as stepwise regression in the linear regression con","Title: 3D Object Recognition Using Unsupervised Feature Extraction  
Abstract: Intrator (1990) proposed a feature extraction method that is related to recent statistical theory (Huber, 1985; Friedman, 1987), and is based on a biologically motivated model of neuronal plasticity (Bienenstock et al., 1982). This method has been recently applied to feature extraction in the context of recognizing 3D objects from single 2D views (Intrator and Gold, 1991). Here we describe experiments designed to analyze the nature of the extracted features, and their relevance to the theory and psychophysics of object recognition.",0
"Title: Using Bayesian networks for incorporating probabilistic a priori knowledge into Boltzmann machines  
Abstract: We present a method for automatically determining the structure and the connection weights of a Boltzmann machine corresponding to a given Bayesian network representation of a probability distribution on a set of discrete variables. The resulting Boltzmann machine structure can be implemented efficiently on massively parallel hardware, since the structure can be divided into two separate clusters where all the nodes in one cluster can be updated simultaneously. The updating process of the Boltzmann machine approximates a Gibbs sampling process of the original Bayesian network in the sense that the Boltzmann machine converges to the same final state as the Gibbs sampler does. The mapping from a Bayesian network to a Boltzmann machine can be seen as a method for incorporating probabilistic a priori information into a neural network architecture, which can then be trained further with existing learning algorithms. ","Title: Constraint Tangent Distance for On-line Character Recognition  
Abstract: In on-line character recognition we can observe two kinds of intra-class variations: small geometric deformations and completely different writing styles. We propose a new approach to deal with these problems by defining an extension of tangent distance [9], well known in off-line character recognition. The system has been implemented with a k-nearest neighbor classifier and a so called diabolo classifier [6] respectively. Both classifiers are invariant under transformations like rotation, scale or slope and can deal with variations in stroke order and writing direction. Results are presented for our digit database with more than 200 writers. ",0
"Title: An Alternative Markov Property for Chain Graphs  
Abstract: Graphical Markov models use graphs, either undirected, directed, or mixed, to represent possible dependences among statistical variables. Applications of undirected graphs (UDGs) include models for spatial dependence and image analysis, while acyclic directed graphs (ADGs), which are especially convenient for statistical analysis, arise in such fields as genetics and psychometrics and as models for expert systems and Bayesian belief networks. Lauritzen, Wer-muth, and Frydenberg (LWF) introduced a Markov property for chain graphs, which are mixed graphs that can be used to represent simultaneously both causal and associative dependencies and which include both UDGs and ADGs as special cases. In this paper an alternative Markov property (AMP) for chain graphs is introduced, which in some ways is a more direct extension of the ADG Markov property than is the LWF property for chain graph.","Title: The Frame Problem and Bayesian Network Action Representations  
Abstract: We examine a number of techniques for representing actions with stochastic effects using Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. We compare these techniques according to ease of specification and size of the representation required for the complete specification of the dynamics of a particular system, paying particular attention the role of persistence relationships. We precisely characterize two components of the frame problem for Bayes nets and stochastic actions, propose several ways to deal with these problems, and compare our solutions with Re-iter's solution to the frame problem for the situation calculus. The result is a set of techniques that permit both ease of specification and compact representation of probabilistic system dynamics that is of comparable size (and timbre) to Reiter's representation (i.e., with no explicit frame axioms).",0
"Title: A Unified Treatment of Uncertainties  
Abstract: Uncertainty in artificial intelligence"" is an active research field, where several approaches have been suggested and studied for dealing with various types of uncertainty. However, it's hard to rank the approaches in general, because each of them is usually aimed at a special application environment. This paper begins by defining such an environment, then show why some existing approaches cannot be used in such a situation. Then a new approach, Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System, is introduced to work in the environment. The system is designed under the assumption that the system's knowledge and resources are usually insufficient to handle the tasks imposed by its environment. The system can consistently represent several types of uncertainty, and can carry out multiple operations on these uncertainties. Finally, the new approach is compared with the previous approaches in terms of uncertainty representation and interpretation.","Title: Genetic Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization: The Assembly Line Balancing Problem  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms are one example of the use of a random element within an algorithm for combinatorial optimization. We consider the application of the genetic algorithm to a particular problem, the Assembly Line Balancing Problem. A general description of genetic algorithms is given, and their specialized use on our test-bed problems is discussed. We carry out extensive computational testing to find appropriate values for the various parameters associated with this genetic algorithm. These experiments underscore the importance of the correct choice of a scaling parameter and mutation rate to ensure the good performance of a genetic algorithm. We also describe a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm and give some comparisons between the parallel and serial implementations. Both versions of the algorithm are shown to be effective in producing good solutions for problems of this type (with appropriately chosen parameters). ",0

"Title: Efficient -Subsumption based on Graph Algorithms  
Abstract: The -subsumption problem is crucial to the efficiency of ILP learning systems. We discuss two -subsumption algorithms based on strategies for preselecting suitable matching literals. The class of clauses, for which subsumption becomes polynomial, is a superset of the deterministic clauses. We further map the general problem of -subsumption to a certain problem of finding a clique of fixed size in a graph, and in return show that a specialization of the pruning strategy of the Car-raghan and Pardalos clique algorithm provides a dramatic reduction of the subsumption search space. We also present empirical results for the mesh design data set.","Title: Model-Based Learning of Structural Indices to Design Cases  
Abstract: A major issue in case-basedsystems is retrieving the appropriate cases from memory to solve a given problem. This implies that a case should be indexed appropriately when stored in memory. A case-based system, being dynamic in that it stores cases for reuse, needs to learn indices for the new knowledge as the system designers cannot envision that knowledge. Irrespective of the type of indexing (structural or functional), a hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models help in learning structural indices to design cases in the domain of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design provides both the vocabulary for structural indexing of design cases and the inductive biases for index generalization. We further discuss how model-based learning can be integrated with similarity-based learning (that uses prior design cases) for learning the level of index generalization. ",0
"Title: An Empirical Evaluation of Bagging and Boosting  
Abstract: An ensemble consists of a set of independently trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman 1996a) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithms. Our results clearly show two important facts. The first is that even though Bagging almost always produces a better classifier than any of its individual component classifiers and is relatively impervious to overfitting, it does not generalize any better than a baseline neural-network ensemble method. The second is that Boosting is a powerful technique that can usually produce better ensembles than Bagging; however, it is more susceptible to noise and can quickly overfit a data set.

"Title: Replicability of Neural Computing Experiments  
Abstract: If an experiment requires statistical analysis to establish a result, then one should do a better experiment. Ernest Rutherford, 1930 Most proponents of cold fusion reporting excess heat from their electrolysis experiments were claiming that one of the main characteristics of cold fusion was its irreproducibility | J.R. Huizenga, Cold Fusion, 1993, p. 78 Abstract Amid the ever increasing research into various aspects of neural computing, much progress is evident both from theoretical advances and from empirical studies. On the empirical side a wealth of data from experimental studies is being reported. It is, however, not clear how best to report neural computing experiments such that they may be replicated by other interested researchers. In particular, the nature of iterative learning on a randomised initial architecture, such as backpropagation training of a multilayer perceptron, is such that precise replication of a reported result is virtually impossible. The outcome is that experimental replication of reported results, a touchstone of ""the scientific method"", is not an option for researchers in this most popular subfield of neural computing. In this paper, we address this issue of replicability of experiments based on backpropagation training of multilayer perceptrons (although many of our results will be applicable to any other subfield that is plagued by the same characteristics). First, we attempt to produce a complete abstract specification of such a neural computing experiment. From this specification we identify the full range of parameters needed to support maximum replicability, and we use it to show why absolute replicability is not an option in practice. We propose a statistical framework to support replicability. We demonstrate this framework with some empirical studies of our own on both repli-cability with respect to experimental controls, and validity of implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. Finally, we suggest how the degree of replicability of a neural computing experiment can be estimated and reflected in the claimed precision for any empirical results reported.

Since special knowledge of an expert is mainly subject to his experiences, the CBR techniques are a good base for the development of expert systems.

This corresponds to the flexible ""case completion"" approach. Flexibility is also needed for the expert view with predominant interest in the unexpected, unpredictible cases. ",0
"Title: Minimum-Risk Profiles of Protein Families Based on Statistical Decision Theory  
Abstract: Statistical decision theory provides a principled way to estimate amino acid frequencies in conserved positions of a protein family. The goal is to minimize the risk function, or the expected squared-error distance between the estimates and the true population frequencies. The minimum-risk estimates are obtained by adding an optimal number of pseudocounts to the observed data. Two formulas are presented, one for pseudocounts based on marginal amino acid frequencies and one for pseudocounts based on the observed data. Experimental results show that profiles constructed using minimal-risk estimates are more discriminating than those constructed using existing methods.","Title: Competitive Anti-Hebbian Learning of Invariants  
Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.",0
"Title: PAC Learning of One-Dimensional Patterns  
Abstract: Developing the ability to recognize a landmark from a visual image of a robot's current location is a fundamental problem in robotics. We consider the problem of PAC-learning the concept class of geometric patterns where the target geometric pattern is a configuration of k points on the real line. Each instance is a configuration of n points on the real line, where it is labeled according to whether or not it visually resembles the target pattern. To capture the notion of visual resemblance we use the Hausdorff metric. Informally, two geometric patterns P and Q resemble each other under the Hausdorff metric, if every point on one pattern is ""close"" to some point on the other pattern. We relate the concept class of geometric patterns to the landmark recognition problem and then present a polynomial-time algorithm that PAC-learns the class of one-dimensional geometric patterns. We also present some experimental results on how our algorithm performs. ","Title: A Unified Analysis of Value-Function-Based Reinforcement-Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness of the theorem lies in how it allows the asynchronous convergence of a complex reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proven by verifying that a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application of the theorem by analyzing the convergence of Q-learning, model-based reinforcement learning, Q-learning with multi-state updates, Q-learning for Markov games, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.

The paradigm meets many of the objectives, with potential for extension to meet the remainder. Empirical results have been promising. For these reasons BRACE has potential as an effective and efficient method for discretization of continuously valued data. A further advantage of BRACE is that it is general enough to be extended to other types of clustering/unsupervised learning. ",0
"Title: TO IMPROVE FORECASTING  
Abstract: Working Paper IS-97-007, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. In: Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance 6 (1998) 14-23. (Special Issue on ""Improving Generalization of Nonlinear Financial Forecasting Models"".) http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~aweigend/Research/Papers/InteractionLayer Abstract. Predictive models for financial data are often based on a large number of plausible inputs that are potentially nonlinearly combined to yield the conditional expectation of a target, such as a daily return of an asset. This paper introduces a new architecture for this task: On the output side, we predict dynamical variables such as first derivatives and curvatures on different time spans. These are subsequently combined in an interaction output layer to form several estimates of the variable of interest. Those estimates are then averaged to yield the final prediction. Independently from this idea, on the input side, we propose a new internal preprocessing layer connected with a diagonal matrix of positive weights to a layer of squashing functions. These weights adapt for each input individually and learn to squash outliers in the input. We apply these two ideas to the real world example of the daily predictions of the German stock index DAX (Deutscher Aktien Index), and compare the results to a network with a single output. The new six layer architecture is more stable in training due to two facts: (1) More information is flowing back from the outputs to the input in the backward pass; (2) The constraint of predicting first and second derivatives focuses the learning on the relevant variables for the dynamics. The architectures are compared from both the training perspective (squared errors, robust errors), and from the trading perspective (annualized returns, percent correct, Sharpe ratio).

Abstract: AI research on case-based reasoning has led to the development of many laboratory case-based systems. As we move towards introducing these systems into work environments, explaining the processes of case-based reasoning is becoming an increasingly important issue. In this paper we describe the notion of a meta-case for illustrating, explaining and justifying case-based reasoning. A meta-case contains a trace of the processing in a problem-solving episode, and provides an explanation of the problem-solving decisions and a (partial) justification for the solution. The language for representing the problem-solving trace depends on the model of problem solving. We describe a task-method-knowledge (TMK) model of problem-solving and describe the representation of meta-cases in the TMK language. We illustrate this explanatory scheme with examples from Interactive Kritik, a computer-based de sign and learning environment presently under development.",0
"Title: Chapter 1 Reinforcement Learning for Planning and Control  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a method for feature subset selection based on Information Theory. Initially, a framework for defining the theoretically optimal, but computation-ally intractable, method for feature subset selection is presented. We show that our goal should be to eliminate a feature if it gives us little or no additional information beyond that subsumed by the remaining features. In particular, this will be the case for both irrelevant and redundant features. We then give an efficient algorithm for feature selection which computes an approximation to the optimal feature selection criterion. The conditions under which the approximate algorithm is successful are examined. Empirical results are given on a number of data sets, showing that the algorithm effectively han dles datasets with large numbers of features.","Title: A Comparison of Crossover and Mutation in Genetic Programming

In this paper we present the results from a very large experimental data set, the equivalent of approximately 12,000 typical runs of a GP system, systematically exploring a range of parameter settings. The resulting data may be useful not only for practitioners seeking to optimize parameters for GP runs, but also for theorists exploring issues such as the role of building blocks in GP.",0

We conduct experiments on tough function optimization problems and observe that by multi-parent operators the performance of GAs can be enhanced significantly. We also give a theoretical foundation by showing how these operators work on distributions.","Title: A Simple Neural Network Models Categorical Perception of Facial Expressions  
Abstract: The performance of a neural network that categorizes facial expressions is compared with human subjects over a set of experiments using interpolated imagery. The experiments for both the human subjects and neural networks make use of interpolations of facial expressions from the Pictures of Facial Affect Database [Ekman and Friesen, 1976]. The only difference in materials between those used in the human subjects experiments [Young et al., 1997] and our materials are the manner in which the interpolated images are constructed - image-quality morphs versus pixel averages. Nevertheless, the neural network accurately captures the categorical nature of the human responses, showing sharp transitions in labeling of images along the interpolated sequence. Crucially for a demonstration of categorical perception [Harnad, 1987], the model shows the highest discrimination between transition images at the crossover point. The model also captures the shape of the reaction time curves of the human subjects along the sequences. Finally, the network matches human subjects' judgements of which expressions are being mixed in the images. The main failing of the model is that there are intrusions of neutral responses in some transitions, which are not seen in the human subjects. We attribute this difference to the difference between the pixel average stimuli and the image quality morph stimuli. These results show that a simple neural network classifier, with no access to the biological constraints that are presumably imposed on the human emotion processor, and whose only access to the surrounding culture is the category labels placed by American subjects on the facial expressions, can nevertheless simulate fairly well the human responses to emotional expressions.

Abstract: 1 This paper demonstrates the tandem use of a finite automata learning algorithm and a utility planner for an adversarial robotic domain. For many applications, robot agents need to predict the movement of objects in the environment and plan to avoid them. When the robot has no reasoning model of the object, machine learning techniques can be used to generate one. In our project, we learn a DFA model of an adversarial robot and use the automaton to predict the next move of the adversary. The robot agent plans a path to avoid the adversary at the predicted location while fulfilling the goal requirements. ","Title: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Learning from Prior Knowledge  
Abstract: This paper introduces a new machine learning task|model calibration|and presents a method for solving a particularly difficult model calibration task that arose as part of a global climate change research project. The model calibration task is the problem of training the free parameters of a scientific model in order to optimize the accuracy of the model for making future predictions. It is a form of supervised learning from examples in the presence of prior knowledge. An obvious approach to solving calibration problems is to formulate them as global optimization problems in which the goal is to find values for the free parameters that minimize the error of the model on training data. Unfortunately, this global optimization approach becomes computationally infeasible when the model is highly nonlinear. This paper presents a new divide-and-conquer method that analyzes the model to identify a series of smaller optimization problems whose sequential solution solves the global calibration problem. This paper argues that methods of this kind|rather than global optimization techniques|will be required in order for agents with large amounts of prior knowledge to learn efficiently. ",0

In all our experiments the evolutionary procedure is carried out entirely on the physical robot without human intervention. We show that the autonomous development of a set of behaviors for locating a battery charger and periodically returning to it can be achieved by lifting constraints in the design of the robot/environment interactions that were employed in a preliminary experiment. The emergent homing behavior is based on the autonomous development of an internal neural topographic map (which is not pre-designed) that allows the robot to choose the appropriate trajectory as function of location and remaining energy.

"Title: Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications  
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration.","Title: Topography And Ocular Dominance: A Model Exploring Positive Correlations  
Abstract: The map from eye to brain in vertebrates is topographic, i.e. neighbouring points in the eye map to neighbouring points in the brain. In addition, when two eyes innervate the same target structure, the two sets of fibres segregate to form ocular dominance stripes. Experimental evidence from the frog and goldfish suggests that these two phenomena may be subserved by the same mechanisms. We present a computational model that addresses the formation of both topography and ocular dominance. The model is based on a form of competitive learning with subtractive enforcement of a weight normalization rule. Inputs to the model are distributed patterns of activity presented simultaneously in both eyes. An important aspect of this model is that ocular dominance segregation can occur when the two eyes are positively correlated, whereas previous models have tended to assume zero or negative correlations between the eyes. This allows investigation of the dependence of the pattern of stripes on the degree of correlation between the eyes: we find that increasing correlation leads to narrower stripes. Experiments are suggested to test this prediction.",0

","Title: Monte Carlo Approach to Bayesian Regression Modeling  
Abstract: In the framework of a functional response model (i.e. a regression model, or a feedforward neural network) an estimator of a nonlinear response function is constructed from a set of functional units. The parameters defining these functional units are estimated using the Bayesian approach. A sample representing the Bayesian posterior distribution is obtained by applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure, namely the combination of Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. The method is described for histogram, B-spline and radial basis function estimators of a response function. In general, the proposed approach is suitable for finding Bayes-optimal values of parameters in a complicated parameter space. We illustrate the method on numerical examples. ",0
"Title: Supervised and Unsupervised Discretization of Continuous Features  
Abstract: Many supervised machine learning algorithms require a discrete feature space. In this paper, we review previous work on continuous feature discretization, identify defining characteristics of the methods, and conduct an empirical evaluation of several methods. We compare binning, an unsupervised discretization method, to entropy-based and purity-based methods, which are supervised algorithms. We found that the performance of the Naive-Bayes algorithm significantly improved when features were discretized using an entropy-based method. In fact, over the 16 tested datasets, the discretized version of Naive-Bayes slightly outperformed C4.5 on average. We also show that in some cases, the performance of the C4.5 induction algorithm significantly improved if features were discretized in advance; in our experiments, the performance never significantly degraded, an interesting phenomenon considering the fact that C4.5 is capable of locally discretiz ing features.","Title: A Study of Genetic Algorithms to Find Approximate Solutions to Hard 3CNF Problems  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been used to solve hard optimization problems ranging from the Travelling Salesman problem to the Quadratic Assignment problem. We show that the Simple Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve an optimization problem derived from the 3-Conjunctive Normal Form problem. By separating the populations into small sub-populations, parallel genetic algorithms exploits the inherent parallelism in genetic algorithms and prevents premature convergence. Genetic algorithms using hill-climbing conduct genetic search in the space of local optima, and hill-climbing can be less com-putationally expensive than genetic search. We examine the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the quality of solutions of 3CNF problems. ",0
"Title: Logarithmic-Time Updates and Queries in Probabilistic Networks  
Abstract: Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in time O(1) and queries are processed in time O(N ), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N ) at the expense of O(log N ) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.","Title: The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN Classification

PAC-like bounds are given on the sample-complexity required to learn the CDM. An experiment is presented in which a neural network CDM was learnt for a Japanese OCR environ ment and then used to do 1-NN classification.",0
"Title: Abduction, Experience, and Goals: A Model of Everyday Abductive Explanation*  
Abstract: When a reasoner explains surprising events for its internal use, a key motivation for explaining is to perform learning that will facilitate the achievement of its goals. Human explainers use a range of strategies to build explanations, including both internal reasoning and external information search, and goal-based considerations have a profound effect on their choices of when and how to pursue explanations. However, standard AI models of explanation rely on goal-neutral use of a single fixed strategy|generally backwards chaining|to build their explanations. This paper argues that explanation should be modeled as a goal-driven learning process for gathering and transforming information, and discusses the issues involved in developing an active multi-strategy process for goal-driven explanation. ","Title: COLLECTIVE ADAPTATION: THE SHARING OF BUILDING BLOCKS  
Abstract: This paper sketches several aspects of a hypothetical cortical architecture for visual object recognition, based on a recent computational model. The scheme relies on modules for learning from examples, such as Hyperbf-like networks, as its basic components. Such models are not intended to be precise theories of the biological circuitry but rather to capture a class of explanations we call Memory-Based Models (MBM) that contains sparse population coding, memory-based recognition and codebooks of prototypes. Unlike the sigmoidal units of some artificial neural networks, the units of MBMs are consistent with the usual description of cortical neurons as tuned to multidimensional optimal stimuli. We will describe how an example of MBM may be realized in terms of cortical circuitry and biophysical mechanisms, consistent with psychophysical and physiological data. A number of predictions, testable with physiological techniques, are made.

"Title: REPRESENTING PHYSICAL AND DESIGN KNOWLEDGE IN INNOVATIVE DESIGN  
Abstract: This paper discusses the unsupervised learning problem. An important part of the unsupervised learning problem is determining the number of constituent groups (components or classes) which best describes some data. We apply the Minimum Message Length (MML) criterion to the unsupervised learning problem, modifying an earlier such MML application. We give an empirical comparison of criteria prominent in the literature for estimating the number of components in a data set. We conclude that the Minimum Message Length criterion performs better than the alternatives on the data considered here for unsupervised learning tasks.","Title: Learning Stochastic Feedforward Networks  
Abstract: Connectionist learning procedures are presented for ""sigmoid"" and ""noisy-OR"" varieties of stochastic feedforward network. These networks are in the same class as the ""belief networks"" used in expert systems. They represent a probability distribution over a set of visible variables using hidden variables to express correlations. Conditional probability distributions can be exhibited by stochastic simulation for use in tasks such as classification. Learning from empirical data is done via a gradient-ascent method analogous to that used in Boltzmann machines, but due to the feedforward nature of the connections, the negative phase of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. Experimental results show that, as a result, learning in a sigmoid feedforward network can be faster than in a Boltzmann machine. These networks have other advantages over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications, and provide a link between work on connectionist learning and work on the representation of expert knowledge.

"Title: The Free Speech  Phoneme Probability Estimation with Dynamic Sparsely Connected Artificial Neural Networks  
Abstract: This paper presents new methods for training large neural networks for phoneme probability estimation. An architecture combining timedelay windows and recurrent connections is used to capture the important dynamic information of the speech signal. Because the number of connections in a fully connected recurrent network grows super-linear with the number of hidden units, schemes for sparse connection and connection pruning are explored. It is found that sparsely connected networks outperform their fully connected counterparts with an equal number of connections. The implementation of the combined architecture and training scheme is described in detail. The networks are evaluated in a hybrid HMM/ANN system for phoneme recognition on the TIMIT database, and for word recognition on the WAXHOLM database. The achieved phone error-rate, 27.8%, for the standard 39 phoneme set on the core testset of the TIMIT database is in the range of the lowest reported. All training and simulation software used is made freely available by the author, and detailed information about the software and the training process is given in an Appendix.

"Title: Cellular Encoding for Interactive Evolutionary Robotics  
Abstract: Research in robotics programming is divided in two camps. The direct hand programmming approach uses an explicit model or a behavioral model ( subsumption architecture). The machine learning community uses neural network and/or genetic algorithm. We claim that hand programming and learning are complementary. The two approaches used together can be orders of magnitude more powerful than each approach taken separately. We propose a method to combine them both. It includes three concepts : syntactic constraints to restrict the search space, hand-made problem decomposition, hand given fitness. We use this method to solve a complex problem ( eight-legged locomotion). It needs 5000 less evaluations compared to when genetic algorithm are used alone.

"Title: How to Get a Free Lunch: A Simple Cost Model for Machine Learning Applications  
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple cost model for machine learning applications based on the notion of net present value. The model extends and unifies the models used in (Pazzani et al., 1994) and (Masand & Piatetsky-Shapiro, 1996). It attempts to answer the question ""Should a given machine learning system now in the prototype stage be fielded?"" The model's inputs are the system's confusion matrix, the cash flow matrix for the application, the cost per decision, the one-time cost of deploying the system, and the rate of return on investment. Like Provost and Fawcett's (1997) ROC convex hull method, the present model can be used for decision-making even when its input variables are not known exactly. Despite its simplicity, it has a number of non-trivial consequences. For example, under it the ""no free lunch"" theorems of learning theory no longer apply. ","Title: Analysis of the Convergence and Generalization of AA1  
Abstract: that is based on Angluin's L fl algorithm. The algorithm maintains a model consistent with its past examples. When a new counterexample arrives it tries to extend the model in a minimal fashion. We conducted a set of experiments where random automata that represent different strategies were generated, and the algorithm tried to learn them based on prefix-closed samples of their behavior. The algorithm managed to learn very compact models that agree with the samples. The size of the sample had a small effect on the size of the model. The experimental results suggest that for random prefix-closed samples the algorithm behaves well. However, following Angluin's result on the difficulty of learning almost uniform complete samples [ An-gluin, 1978 ] , it is obvious that our algorithm does not solve the complexity issue of inferring a DFA from a general prefix-closed sample. We are currently looking for classes of prefix-closed samples in which US-L* behaves well. [ Carmel and Markovitch, 1994 ] D. Carmel and S. Markovitch.

"Title: On Finite Gain Stabilizability of Linear Systems Subject to Input Saturation  
Abstract: This paper deals with (global) finite-gain input/output stabilization of linear systems with saturated controls. For neutrally stable systems, it is shown that the linear feedback law suggested by the passivity approach indeed provides stability, with respect to every L p -norm. Explicit bounds on closed-loop gains are obtained, and they are related to the norms for the respective systems without saturation. These results do not extend to the class of systems for which the state matrix has eigenvalues on the imaginary axis with nonsimple (size &gt; 1) Jordan blocks, contradicting what may be expected from the fact that such systems are globally asymptotically stabilizable in the state-space sense; this is shown in particular for the double integrator.

"Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine  
Abstract: The clausal discovery engine claudien is presented. claudien discovers regularities in data and is a representative of the inductive logic programming paradigm. As such, it represents data and regularities by means of first order clausal theories. Because the search space of clausal theories is larger than that of attribute value representation, claudien also accepts as input a declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities. Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique. In order to achieve this aim, we show how claudien can be used to learn 1) integrity constraints in databases, 2) functional dependencies and determinations, 3) properties of sequences, 4) mixed quantitative and qualitative laws, 5) reverse engineering, and 6) classification rules. ","Title: How Lateral Interaction Develops in a Self-Organizing Feature Map  
Abstract: A biologically motivated mechanism for self-organizing a neural network with modifiable lateral connections is presented. The weight modification rules are purely activity-dependent, unsupervised and local. The lateral interaction weights are initially random but develop into a ""Mexican hat"" shape around each neuron. At the same time, the external input weights self-organize to form a topological map of the input space. The algorithm demonstrates how self-organization can bootstrap itself using input information. Predictions of the algorithm agree very well with experimental observations on the development of lateral connections in cortical feature maps. ",0
"Title: Information-based objective functions for active data selection  
Abstract: Learning can be made more efficient if we can actively select particularly salient data points. Within a Bayesian learning framework, objective functions are discussed which measure the expected informativeness of candidate measurements. Three alternative specifications of what we want to gain information about lead to three different criteria for data selection. All these criteria depend on the assumption that the hypothesis space is correct, which may prove to be their main weakness. ","Title: Convergence Rates of Approximation by Translates  
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating a function belonging to some function space by a linear combination of n translates of a given function G. Using a lemma by Jones (1990) and Barron (1991) we show that it is possible to define function spaces and functions G for which the rate of convergence to zero of the error is O( 1 p n ) in any number of dimensions. The apparent avoidance of the ""curse of dimensionality"" is due to the fact that these function spaces are more and more constrained as the dimension increases. Examples include spaces of the Sobolev type, in which the number of weak derivatives is required to be larger than the number of dimensions. We give results both for approximation in the L 2 norm and in the L 1 norm. The interesting feature of these results is that, thanks to the constructive nature of Jones' and Barron's lemma, an iterative procedure is defined that can achieve this rate.

"Title: Trees and Splines in Survival Analysis  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 275 Revised March 30, 1995 University of Washington Department of Statistics Seattle, Washington 98195 Abstract During the past few years several nonparametric alternatives to the Cox proportional hazards model have appeared in the literature. These methods extend techniques that are well known from regression analysis to the analysis of censored survival data. In this paper we discuss methods based on (partition) trees and (polynomial) splines, analyze two datasets using both Survival Trees[1] and HARE[2], and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods. One of the strengths of HARE is that its model fitting procedure has an implicit check for proportionality of the underlying hazards model. It also provides an explicit model for the conditional hazards function, which makes it very convenient to obtain graphical summaries. On the other hand, the tree-based methods automatically partition a dataset into groups of cases that are similar in survival history. Results obtained by survival trees and HARE are often complimentary. Trees and splines in survival analysis should provide the data analyst with two useful tools when analyzing survival data.","Title: Evolving Visual Routines  
Abstract: Traditional machine vision assumes that the vision system recovers a a complete, labeled description of the world [ Marr, 1982 ] . Recently, several researchers have criticized this model and proposed an alternative model which considers perception as a distributed collection of task-specific, task-driven visual routines [ Aloimonos, 1993, Ullman, 1987 ] . Some of these researchers have argued that in natural living systems these visual routines are the product of natural selection [ Ramachandran, 1985 ] . So far, researchers have hand-coded task-specific visual routines for actual implementations (e.g. [ Chapman, 1993 ] ). In this paper we propose an alternative approach in which visual routines for simple tasks are evolved using an artificial evolution approach. We present results from a series of runs on actual camera images, in which simple routines were evolved using Genetic Programming techniques [ Koza, 1992 ] . The results obtained are promising: the evolved routines are able to correctly classify up to 93% of the images, which is better than the best algorithm we were able to write by hand. ",0
"Title: Impediments to Universal Preference-Based Default Theories  
Abstract: Research on nonmonotonic and default reasoning has identified several important criteria for preferring alternative default inferences. The theories of reasoning based on each of these criteria may uniformly be viewed as theories of rational inference, in which the reasoner selects maximally preferred states of belief. Though researchers have noted some cases of apparent conflict between the preferences supported by different theories, it has been hoped that these special theories of reasoning may be combined into a universal logic of nonmonotonic reasoning. We show that the different categories of preferences conflict more than has been realized, and adapt formal results from social choice theory to prove that every universal theory of default reasoning will violate at least one reasonable principle of rational reasoning. Our results can be interpreted as demonstrating that, within the preferential framework, we cannot expect much improvement on the rigid lexicographic priority mechanisms that have been proposed for conflict resolution.","Title: Intelligent Model Selection for Hillclimbing Search in Computer-Aided Design  
Abstract: Models of physical systems can differ according to computational cost, accuracy and precision, among other things. Depending on the problem solving task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is novel in that we are developing model selection techniques specifically suited to computer-aided de sign. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design should be chosen in light of the design decisions they are required to support. We have developed a technique called ""Gradient Magnitude Model Selection"" (GMMS), which embodies this principle. GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing search process. It selects the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimb-ing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS makes the design process faster than it would be if the most expensive model were used for all design evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality of the resulting design. ",0
"Title: Automated Decomposition of Model-based Learning Problems  
Abstract: A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed autonomous systems is being developed that has the potential for unprecedented performance, such as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a formalization of decompositional, model-based learning (DML), a method developed by observing a modeler's expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between learning and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty, an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a significant improvement in learning rate. ","Title: Knowledge-Based Genetic Learning  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been proven to be a powerful tool within the area of machine learning. However, there are some classes of problems where they seem to be scarcely applicable, e.g. when the solution to a given problem consists of several parts that influence each other. In that case the classic genetic operators cross-over and mutation do not work very well thus preventing a good performance. This paper describes an approach to overcome this problem by using high-level genetic operators and integrating task specific but domain independent knowledge to guide the use of these operators. The advantages of this approach are shown for learning a rule base to adapt the parameters of an image processing operator path within the SOLUTION system.",0

","Title: Induction of decision trees using RELIEFF  
Abstract: An investigation into the dynamics of Genetic Programming applied to chaotic time series prediction is reported. An interesting characteristic of adaptive search techniques is their ability to perform well in many problem domains while failing in others. Because of Genetic Programming's flexible tree structure, any particular problem can be represented in myriad forms. These representations have variegated effects on search performance. Therefore, an aspect of fundamental engineering significance is to find a representation which, when acted upon by Genetic Programming operators, optimizes search performance. We discover, in the case of chaotic time series prediction, that the representation commonly used in this domain does not yield optimal solutions. Instead, we find that the population converges onto one ""accurately replicating"" tree before other trees can be explored. To correct for this premature convergence we make a simple modification to the crossover operator. In this paper we review previous work with GP time series prediction, pointing out an anomalous result related to overlearning, and report the improvement effected by our modified crossover operator.

"Title: Modeling Belief in Dynamic Systems. Part I: Foundations  
Abstract: Belief change is a fundamental problem in AI: Agents constantly have to update their beliefs to accommodate new observations. In recent years, there has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining appropriate semantic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in which to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility: an agent believes if he knows that is more plausible than :. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge, plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of Halpern and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then examine the problem of ""minimal change"". This notion can be captured by using prior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated by ""conditioning"". We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility measure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show how the two best-studied scenarios of belief change, belief revision and belief update, fit into our framework. ?

"Title: Adaptive Boosting of Neural Networks for Character Recognition  
Abstract: Technical Report #1072, D epartement d'Informatique et Recherche Op erationnelle, Universit e de Montr eal Abstract Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], in particular decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks applied to character recognition tasks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 2% error on the UCI Letters offline characters data set.","Title: Segmenting Time Series using Gated Experts with Simulated Annealing  
Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.",0
"Title: Learning Markov chains with variable memory length from noisy output  
Abstract: The problem of modeling complicated data sequences, such as DNA or speech, often arises in practice. Most of the algorithms select a hypothesis from within a model class assuming that the observed sequence is the direct output of the underlying generation process. In this paper we consider the case when the output passes through a memoryless noisy channel before observation. In particular, we show that in the class of Markov chains with variable memory length, learning is affected by factors, which, despite being super-polynomial, are still small in some practical cases. Markov models with variable memory length, or probabilistic finite suffix automata, were introduced in learning theory by Ron, Singer and Tishby who also described a polynomial time learning algorithm [11, 12]. We present a modification of the algorithm which uses a noise-corrupted sample and has knowledge of the noise structure. The same algorithm is still viable if the noise is not known exactly but a good estimation is available. Finally, some experimental results are presented for removing noise from corrupted English text, and to measure how the performance of the learning algorithm is affected by the size of the noisy sample and the noise rate.

These systems are inherently more powerful than their linear counterparts (such as Markov chains), which have had a wide impact in Computer Science, and they seem likely to play an increasing role in future. However, there are as yet no general techniques available for handling the computational aspects of discrete nonlinear systems, and even the simplest examples seem very hard to analyze. We focus in this paper on a class of quadratic systems that are widely used as a model in population genetics and also in genetic algorithms. These systems describe a process where random matings occur between parental chromosomes via a mechanism known as ""crossover"": i.e., children inherit pieces of genetic material from different parents according to some random rule. Our results concern two fundamental quantitative properties of crossover systems: 1. We develop a general technique for computing the ",0

Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural networks is that typically the concept representations they form are more easily understood by humans. One approach to understanding the representations formed by neural networks is to extract symbolic rules from trained networks. In this paper we describe and investigate an approach for extracting rules from networks that uses (1) the NofM extraction algorithm, and (2) the network training method of soft weight-sharing. Previously, the NofM algorithm had been successfully applied only to knowledge-based neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our extracted rules generalize better than rules learned using the C4.5 system. In addition to being accurate, our extracted rules are also reasonably comprehensible.",0
"Title: A Neural Model of the Cortical Representation of Egocentric Distance  
Abstract: Wavelets are of wide potential use in statistical contexts. The basics of the discrete wavelet transform are reviewed using a filter notation that is useful subsequently in the paper. A `stationary wavelet transform', where the coefficient sequences are not decimated at each stage, is described. Two different approaches to the construction of an inverse of the stationary wavelet transform are set out. The application of the stationary wavelet transform as an exploratory statistical method is discussed, together with its potential use in nonparametric regression. A method of local spectral density estimation is developed. This involves extensions to the wavelet context of standard time series ideas such as the periodogram and spectrum. The technique is illustrated by its application to data sets from astronomy and veterinary anatomy.","Title: Pessimistic decision tree pruning based on tree size  
Abstract: In this work we develop a new criteria to perform pessimistic decision tree pruning. Our method is theoretically sound and is based on theoretical concepts such as uniform convergence and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. We show that our criteria is very well motivated, from the theory side, and performs very well in practice. The accuracy of the new criteria is comparable to that of the current method used in C4.5.",0
"Title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems  
Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learning algorithms in recent years, partly due to successes in the theoretical analysis of their behavior in Markov environments. If the Markov assumption is removed, however, neither generally the algorithms nor the analyses continue to be usable. We propose and analyze a new learning algorithm to solve a certain class of non-Markov decision problems. Our algorithm applies to problems in which the environment is Markov, but the learner has restricted access to state information. The algorithm involves a Monte-Carlo policy evaluation combined with a policy improvement method that is similar to that of Markov decision problems and is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. The algorithm operates in the space of stochastic policies, a space which can yield a policy that performs considerably better than any deterministic policy. Although the space of stochastic policies is continuous|even for a discrete action space|our algorithm is computationally tractable. ","Title: Learning Decision Trees from Decision Rules:  
Abstract: A method and initial results from a comparative study ABSTRACT A standard approach to determining decision trees is to learn them from examples. A disadvantage of this approach is that once a decision tree is learned, it is difficult to modify it to suit different decision making situations. Such problems arise, for example, when an attribute assigned to some node cannot be measured, or there is a significant change in the costs of measuring attributes or in the frequency distribution of events from different decision classes. An attractive approach to resolving this problem is to learn and store knowledge in the form of decision rules, and to generate from them, whenever needed, a decision tree that is most suitable in a given situation. An additional advantage of such an approach is that it facilitates building compact decision trees , which can be much simpler than the logically equivalent conventional decision trees (by compact trees are meant decision trees that may contain branches assigned a set of values , and nodes assigned derived attributes, i.e., attributes that are logical or mathematical functions of the original ones). The paper describes an efficient method, AQDT-1, that takes decision rules generated by an AQ-type learning system (AQ15 or AQ17), and builds from them a decision tree optimizing a given optimality criterion. The method can work in two modes: the standard mode , which produces conventional decision trees, and compact mode, which produces compact decision trees. The preliminary experiments with AQDT-1 have shown that the decision trees generated by it from decision rules (conventional and compact) have outperformed those generated from examples by the well-known C4.5 program both in terms of their simplicity and their predictive accuracy.

"Title: A System for Induction of Oblique Decision Trees  
Abstract: This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.","Title: On The State of Evolutionary Computation  
Abstract: In the past few years the evolutionary computation landscape has been rapidly changing as a result of increased levels of interaction between various research groups and the injection of new ideas which challenge old tenets. The effect has been simultaneously exciting, invigorating, annoying, and bewildering to the old-timers as well as the new-comers to the field. Emerging out of all of this activity are the beginnings of some structure, some common themes, and some agreement on important open issues. We attempt to summarize these emergent properties in this paper. ",0
"Title: Similarity Metrics: A Formal Unification of Cardinal and Non-Cardinal Similarity Measures  
Abstract: In [9] we introduced a formal framework for constructing ordinal similarity measures, and suggested how this might also be applied to cardinal measures. In this paper we will place this approach in a more general framework, called similarity metrics. In this framework, ordinal similarity metrics (where comparison returns a boolean value) can be combined with cardinal metrics (returning a numeric value) and, indeed, with metrics returning values of other types, to produce new metrics.","Title: Reports of the GMU Machine Learning and Inference HOW DID AQ FACE THE EAST-WEST CHALLENGE?
Abstract: The East-West Challenge is the title of the second international competition of machine learning programs, organized in the Fall 1994 by Donald Michie, Stephen Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan from Oxford University. The goal of the competition was to solve the TRAINS problems, that is to discover the simplest classification rules for train-like structured objects. The rule complexity was judged by a Prolog program that counted the number of various components in the rule expressed in the from of Prolog Horn clauses. There were 65 entries from several countries submitted to the competition. The GMU teams entry was generated by three members of the AQ family of learning programs: AQ-DT, INDUCE and AQ17-HCI. The paper analyses the results obtained by these programs and compares them to those obtained by other learning programs. It also presents ideas for further research that were inspired by the competition. One of these ideas is a challenge to the machine learning community to develop a measure of knowledge complexity that would adequately capture the cognitive complexity of knowledge. A preliminary measure of such cognitive complexity, called Ccomplexity, different from the Prolog-complexity (P-complexity) used in the competition, is briefly discussed. The authors thank Professors Donald Michie, Steve Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan for organizing the West-East Challenge competition of machine learning programs, which provided us with a stimulating challenge for our learning programs and inspired new ideas for improving them. The authors also thank Nabil Allkharouf and Ali Hadjarian for their help and suggestions in the efforts to solve problems posed by the competition.

"Title: Learning Algorithms with Applications to Robot Navigation and Protein Folding  
Abstract: Using scene analysis as the task, this research focuses on three fundamental problems in neural network systems: (1) limited processing resources, (2) representing schemas, and (3) learning schemas. The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures. ","Title: Von Mises type statistics for single site updated local interaction random fields  
Abstract: Random field models in image analysis and spatial statistics usually have local interactions. They can be simulated by Markov chains which update a single site at a time. The updating rules typically condition on only a few neighboring sites. If we want to approximate the expectation of a bounded function, can we make better use of the simulations than through the empirical estimator? We describe symmetrizations of the empirical estimator which are computationally feasible and can lead to considerable variance reduction. The method is reminiscent of the idea behind generalized von Mises statistics. To simplify the exposition, we consider mainly nearest neighbor random fields and the Gibbs sampler. ",0
"Title: CuPit-2: Portable and Efficient High-Level Parallel Programming of Neural Networks for the Systems Analysis Modelling
Abstract: CuPit-2 is a special-purpose programming language designed for expressing dynamic neural network learning algorithms. It provides most of the flexibility of general-purpose languages such as C or C ++ , but is more expressive. It allows writing much clearer and more elegant programs, in particular for algorithms that change the network topology dynamically (constructive algorithms, pruning algorithms). In contrast to other languages, CuPit-2 programs can be compiled into efficient code for parallel machines without any changes in the source program, thus providing an easy start for using parallel platforms. This article analyzes the circumstances under which the CuPit-2 approach is the most useful one, presents a description of most language constructs and reports performance results for CuPit-2 on symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). It concludes that in many cases CuPit-2 is a good basis for neural learning algorithm research on small-scale parallel machines. ","Title: Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on
Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised induction of a distance from examples described as Horn clauses or constrained clauses. In opposition to syntax-driven approaches, this approach is discrimination-driven: it proceeds by defining a small set of complex discriminant hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as new concepts, used to redescribe the initial examples. Further, this redescription can be embedded into the space of natural integers, and a distance between examples thus naturally follows. ",0
"Title: Language Series Revisited: The Complexity of Hypothesis Spaces in ILP  
Abstract: Restrictions on the number and depth of existential variables as defined in the language series of Clint [Rae92] are widely used in ILP and expected to produce a considerable reduction in the size of the hypothesis space. In this paper we show that this is generally not the case. The lower bounds we present lead to intractable hypothesis spaces except for toy domains. We argue that the parameters chosen in Clint are unsuitable for sensible bias shift operations, and propose alternative approaches resulting in the desired reduction of the hypothesis space and allowing for a natural integration of the shift of bias.","Title: Learning Adaptation Strategies by Introspective Reasoning about Memory Search  
Abstract: In case-based reasoning systems, the case adaptation process is traditionally controlled by static libraries of hand-coded adaptation rules. This paper proposes a method for learning adaptation knowledge in the form of adaptation strategies of the type developed and hand-coded by Kass [90] . Adaptation strategies differ from standard adaptation rules in that they encode general memory search procedures for finding the information needed during case adaptation; this paper focuses on the issues involved in learning memory search procedures to form the basis of new adaptation strategies. It proposes a method that starts with a small library of abstract adaptation rules and uses introspective reasoning about the system's memory organization to generate the memory search plans needed to apply those rules. The search plans are then packaged with the original abstract rules to form new adaptation strategies for future use. This process allows a CBR system not only to learn about its domain, by storing the results of case adaptation, but also to learn how to apply the cases in its memory more effectively. ",0
"Title: Structured Reachability Analysis for Markov Decision Processes  
Abstract: Recent research in decision theoretic planning has focussed on making the solution of Markov decision processes (MDPs) more feasible. We develop a family of algorithms for structured reachability analysis of MDPs that are suitable when an initial state (or set of states) is known. Using compact, structured representations of MDPs (e.g., Bayesian networks), our methods, which vary in the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, produce structured descriptions of (estimated) reachable states that can be used to eliminate variables or variable values from the problem description, reducing the size of the MDP and making it easier to solve. One contribution of our work is the extension of ideas from GRAPHPLAN to deal with the distributed nature of action representations typically embodied within Bayes nets and the problem of correlated action effects. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be made more complete by using k-ary constraints instead of binary constraints. Another contribution is the illustration of how the compact representation of reachability constraints can be exploited by several existing (exact and approximate) abstraction algorithms for MDPs.","Title: Structured Arc Reversal and Simulation of Dynamic Probabilistic Networks  
Abstract: We present an algorithm for arc reversal in Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables, and consider some of its advantages, especially for the simulation of dynamic probabilistic networks. In particular, the method allows one to produce CPTs for nodes involved in the reversal that exploit regularities in the conditional distributions. We argue that this approach alleviates some of the overhead associated with arc reversal, plays an important role in evidence integration and can be used to restrict sampling of variables in DPNs. We also provide an algorithm that detects the dynamic irrelevance of state variables in forward simulation. This algorithm exploits the structured CPTs in a reversed network to determine, in a time-independent fashion, the conditions under which a variable does or does not need to be sampled.",0
"Title: Fitness Landscapes and Difficulty in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: The structure of the fitness landscape on which genetic programming operates is examined. The landscapes of a range of problems of known difficulty are analyzed in an attempt to determine which landscape measures correlate with the difficulty of the problem. The autocorrelation of the fitness values of random walks, a measure which has been shown to be related to perceived difficulty using other techniques, is only a weak indicator of the difficulty as perceived by genetic programming. All of these problems show unusually low autocorrelation. Comparison of the range of landscape basin depths at the end of adaptive walks on the landscapes shows good correlation with problem difficulty, over the entire range of problems examined. ","Title: Induction of decision trees and Bayesian classification applied to diagnosis of sport injuries  
Abstract: Machine learning techniques can be used to extract knowledge from data stored in medical databases. In our application, various machine learning algorithms were used to extract diagnostic knowledge to support the diagnosis of sport injuries. The applied methods include variants of the Assistant algorithm for top-down induction of decision trees, and variants of the Bayesian classifier. The available dataset was insufficent for reliable diagnosis of all sport injuries considered by the system. Consequently, expert-defined diagnostic rules were added and used as pre-classifiers or as generators of additional training instances for injuries with few training examples. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy and the explanation capability of the naive Bayesian classifier with the fuzzy discretization of numerical attributes was superior to other methods and was estimated as the most appro priate for practical use.",0
"Title: An Improved Model for Spatially Correlated Binary Responses  
Abstract: In this paper we extend the basic autologistic model to include covariates and an indication of sampling effort. The model is applied to sampled data instead of the traditional use for image analysis where complete data are available. We adopt a Bayesian set-up and develop a hybrid Gibbs sampling estimation procedure. Using simulated examples, we show that the autologistic model with covariates for sample data improves predictions as compared to the simple logistic regression model and the standard autologistic model (without covariates).

The example consists of a set of 125 training instances, with four weights and a threshold to be learnt. We do not know if substantially smaller binary examples exist. ",0
"Title: Networks of Spiking Neurons: The Third Generation of Neural Network Models  
Abstract: The computational power of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other neural network models based on McCulloch Pitts neurons (i.e. threshold gates) respectively sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neuro biology.","Title: An Efficient Method To Estimate Bagging's Generalization Error  
Abstract: In bagging [Bre94a] one uses bootstrap replicates of the training set [Efr79, ET93] to try to improve a learning algorithm's performance. The computational requirements for estimating the resultant generalization error on a test set by means of cross-validation are often prohibitive; for leave-one-out cross-validation one needs to train the underlying algorithm on the order of m- times, where m is the size of the training set and is the number of replicates. This paper presents several techniques for exploiting the bias-variance decomposition [GBD92, Wol96] to estimate the generalization error of a bagged learning algorithm without invoking yet more training of the underlying learning algorithm. The best of our estimators exploits stacking [Wol92]. In a set of experiments reported here, it was found to be more accurate than both the alternative cross-validation-based estimator of the bagged algorithm's error and the cross-validation-based estimator of the underlying algorithm's error. This improvement was particularly pronounced for small test sets. This suggests a novel justification for using bagging| im proved estimation of generalization error.",0
"Title: EMRBF: A Statistical Basis for Using Radial Basis Functions for Process Control  
Abstract: Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks offer an attractive equation form for use in model-based control because they can approximate highly nonlinear plants and yet are well suited for linear adaptive control. We show how interpreting RBFs as mixtures of Gaussians allows the application of many statistical tools including the EM algorithm for parameter estimation. The resulting EMRBF models give uncertainty estimates and warn when they are extrapolating beyond the region where training data was available. ","Title: On Pruning and Averaging Decision Trees  
Abstract: Pruning a decision tree is considered by some researchers to be the most important part of tree building in noisy domains. While, there are many approaches to pruning, an alternative approach of averaging over decision trees has not received as much attention. We perform an empirical comparison of pruning with the approach of averaging over decision trees. For this comparison we use a computa-tionally efficient method of averaging, namely averaging over the extended fanned set of a tree. Since there are a wide range of approaches to pruning, we compare tree averaging with a traditional pruning approach, along with an optimal pruning approach.",0
"Title: A Parallel Learning Algorithm for Bayesian Inference Networks  
Abstract: We present a new parallel algorithm for learning Bayesian inference networks from data. Our learning algorithm exploits both properties of the MDL-based score metric, and a distributed, asynchronous, adaptive search technique called nagging.

We demonstrate the viability, effectiveness, and scalability of our approach empirically with several experiments using on the order of 20 machines. More specifically, we show that our distributed algorithm can provide optimal solutions for larger problems as well as good solutions for Bayesian networks of up to 150 variables. ","Title: Development of triadic neural circuits for visual image stabilization under eye movements  
Abstract: Human visual systems maintain a stable internal representation of a scene even though the image on the retina is constantly changing because of eye movements. Such stabilization can theoretically be effected by dynamic shifts in the receptive field (RF) of neurons in the visual system. This paper examines how a neural circuit can learn to generate such shifts. The shifts are controlled by eye position signals and compensate for the movement in the retinal image caused by eye movements. The development of a neural shifter circuit (Olshausen, Anderson, & Van Essen, 1992) is modeled using triadic connections. These connections are gated by signals that indicate the direction of gaze (eye position signals). In simulations, a neural model is exposed to sequences of stimuli paired with appropriate eye position signals. The initially ",0

The cooperative coevolutionary approach encourages the parallel evolution of substructures which interact in useful ways to form more complex higher level structures. The architecture is designed to be general enough to permit the inclusion, if appropriate, of a priori knowledge in the form of initial biases towards particular kinds of decompositions. A brief summary of initial results obtained from testing this architecture in several problem domains is presented which shows a significant speedup over more traditional non-coevolutionary approaches.

"Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Diagnostics: A Comparative Review  
Abstract: A critical issue for users of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.

Abstract: This paper outlines some problems that may occur with Reduced Error Pruning in Inductive Logic Programming, most notably efficiency. Thereafter a new method, Incremental Reduced Error Pruning, is proposed that attempts to address all of these problems.

However, the experiments show as well that the use of this algorithm cannot be recommended for domains with a very specific concept description. ","Title: Perfect Simulation in Stochastic Geometry  
Abstract: Simulation plays an important role in stochastic geometry and related fields, because all but the simplest random set models tend to be intractable to analysis. Many simulation algorithms deliver (approximate) samples of such random set models, for example by simulating the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain such as a spatial birth-and-death process. The samples usually fail to be exact because the algorithm simulates the Markov chain for a long but finite time, and thus convergence to equilibrium is only approximate. The seminal work by Propp and Wilson made an important contribution to simulation by proposing a coupling method, Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which delivers perfect, that is to say exact, simulations of Markov chains. In this paper we introduce this new idea of perfect simulation and illustrate it using two common models in stochastic geometry: the dead leaves model and a Boolean model conditioned to cover a finite set of points.

"Title: Spline Smoothing For Bivariate Data With Applications To Association Between Hormones  
Abstract: Standard methods for inducing both the structure and weight values of recurrent neural networks fit an assumed class of architectures to every task. This simplification is necessary because the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computation, which includes genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, is a population-based search method that has shown promise in such complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. This algorithms empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods.

We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface. Based on these mathematical results, we present a comparative discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of EM and other algorithms for the learning of Gaussian mixture models.

"Title: Independent Component Analysis of Electroencephalographic Data  
Abstract: Because of the distance between the skull and brain and their different resistivities, electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected from any point on the human scalp includes activity generated within a large brain area. This spatial smearing of EEG data by volume conduction does not involve significant time delays, however, suggesting that the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski [1] is suitable for performing blind source separation on EEG data. The ICA algorithm separates the problem of source identification from that of source localization. First results of applying the ICA algorithm to EEG and event-related potential (ERP) data collected during a sustained auditory detection task show: (1) ICA training is insensitive to different random seeds. (2) ICA may be used to segregate obvious artifactual EEG components (line and muscle noise, eye movements) from other sources. (3) ICA is capable of isolating overlapping EEG phenomena, including alpha and theta bursts and spatially-separable ERP components, to separate ICA channels. (4) Nonstationarities in EEG and behavioral state can be tracked using ICA via changes in the amount of residual correlation between ICA-filtered output channels.

This previous project has also established a JANUS(T)-NTC computer simulation/wargame of NTC, providing a statistical ``what-if '' capability for NTC scenarios. This mathematical formulation is ripe for control-theoretic extension to include human factors, a methodology previously developed in the context of teleoperated vehicles. Similar NTC scenarios differing at crucial decision points will be used for data to model the inuence of decision making on combat. The results may then be used to improve present human factors and C 2 algorithms in computer simulations/wargames. Our approach is to ``subordinate'' the SMC nonlinear stochastic equations, fitted to NTC scenarios, to establish the zeroth order description of that combat. In practice, an equivalent mathematical-physics representation is used, more suitable for numerical and formal work, i.e., a Lagrangian representation. Theoretically, these equations are nested within a larger set of nonlinear stochastic operator-equations which include C 3 human factors, e.g., supervisory decisions. In this study, we propose to perturb this operator theory about the SMC zeroth order set of equations. Then, subsets of scenarios fit to zeroth order, originally considered to be similarly degenerate, can be further split perturbatively to distinguish C 3 decision-making inuences. New methods of Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (VFSR), developed in the previous project, will be used for fitting these models to empirical data. ",0
"Title: A Computational Environment for Exhaust Nozzle Design  
Abstract: The Nozzle Design Associate (NDA) is a computational environment for the design of jet engine exhaust nozzles for supersonic aircraft. NDA may be used either to design new aircraft or to design new nozzles that adapt existing aircraft so they may be reutilized for new missions. NDA was developed in a collaboration between computer scientists at Rut-gers University and exhaust nozzle designers at General Electric Aircraft Engines and General Electric Corporate Research and Development. The NDA project has two principal goals: to provide a useful engineering tool for exhaust nozzle design, and to explore fundamental research issues that arise in the application of automated design optimization methods to realistic engineering problems.

For each category of GA programming environment we review their common features and present a case study of a leading environment. ",0
"Title: A Comparison of Dynamic Reposing and Tangent Distance for Drug Activity Prediction  
Abstract: In drug activity prediction (as in handwritten character recognition), the features extracted to describe a training example depend on the pose (location, orientation, etc.) of the example. In handwritten character recognition, one of the best techniques for addressing this problem is the tangent distance method of Simard, LeCun and Denker (1993). Jain, et al. (1993a; 1993b) introduce a new technique|dynamic reposing|that also addresses this problem. Dynamic reposing iteratively learns a neural network and then reposes the examples in an effort to maximize the predicted output values. New models are trained and new poses computed until models and poses converge. This paper compares dynamic reposing to the tangent distance method on the task of predicting the biological activity of musk compounds.

"Title: Naive Bayesian classifier within ILP-R  
Abstract: When dealing with the classification problems, current ILP systems often lag behind state-of-the-art attributional learners. Part of the blame can be ascribed to a much larger hypothesis space which, therefore, cannot be as thoroughly explored. However, sometimes it is due to the fact that ILP systems do not take into account the probabilistic aspects of hypotheses when classifying unseen examples. This paper proposes just that. We developed a naive Bayesian classifier within our ILP-R first order learner. The learner itself uses a clever RELIEF based heuristic which is able to detect strong dependencies within the literal space when such dependencies exist. We conducted a series of experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. The results show that the combination of ILP-R together with the naive Bayesian classifier sometimes significantly improves the classification of unseen instances as measured by both classification accuracy and average information score.","Title: An evolutionary tabu search algorithm and the NHL scheduling problem  
Abstract: We present in this paper a new evolutionary procedure for solving general optimization problems that combines efficiently the mechanisms of genetic algorithms and tabu search. In order to explore the solution space properly interaction phases are interspersed with periods of optimization in the algorithm. An adaptation of this search principle to the National Hockey League (NHL) problem is discussed. The hybrid method developed in this paper is well suited for Open Shop Scheduling problems (OSSP). The results obtained appear to be quite satisfactory. ",0
"Title: Face Recognition: A Hybrid Neural Network Approach  
Abstract: Faces represent complex, multidimensional, meaningful visual stimuli and developing a computational model for face recognition is difficult (Turk and Pentland, 1991). We present a hybrid neural network solution which compares favorably with other methods. The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The self-organizing map provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides for partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the self-organizing map, and a multilayer perceptron in place of the convolutional network. The Karhunen-Loeve transform performs almost as well (5.3% error versus 3.8%). The multilayer perceptron performs very poorly (40% error versus 3.8%). The method is capable of rapid classification, requires only fast, approximate normalization and preprocessing, and consistently exhibits better classification performance than the eigenfaces approach (Turk and Pentland, 1991) on the database considered as the number of images per person in the training database is varied from 1 to 5. With 5 images per person the proposed method and eigenfaces result in 3.8% and 10.5% error respectively. The recognizer provides a measure of confidence in its output and classification error approaches zero when rejecting as few as 10% of the examples. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer. ","Title: Adaptive Noise Injection for Input Variables Relevance Determination  
Abstract: In this paper we consider the application of training with noise in multi-layer perceptron to input variables relevance determination. Noise injection is modified in order to penalize irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm is attractive as it requires the tuning of a single parameter. This parameter controls the penalization of the inputs together with the complexity of the model. After the presentation of the method, experimental evidences are given on simulated data sets.",0
"Title: Type Inheritance in Strongly Typed Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper appears as chapter 18 of Kenneth E. Kinnear, Jr. and Peter J. Angeline, editors Advances in Genetic Programming 2, MIT Press, 1996. Abstract Genetic Programming (GP) is an automatic method for generating computer programs, which are stored as data structures and manipulated to evolve better programs. An extension restricting the search space is Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP), which has, as a basic premise, the removal of closure by typing both the arguments and return values of functions, and by also typing the terminal set. A restriction of STGP is that there are only two levels of typing. We extend STGP by allowing a type hierarchy, which allows more than two levels of typing. ","Title: Towards Mixed-Initiative Rationale-Supported Planning  
Abstract: This paper introduces our work on mixed-initiative, rationale-supported planning. The work centers on the principled reuse and modification of past plans by exploiting their justification structure. The goal is to record as much as possible of the rationale underlying each planning decision in a mixed-initiative framework where human and machine planners interact. This rationale is used to determine which past plans are relevant to a new situation, to focus user's modification and replanning on different relevant steps when external circumstances dictate, and to ensure consistency in multi-user distributed scenarios. We build upon our previous work in Prodigy/Analogy, which incorporates algorithms to capture and reuse the rationale of an automated planner during its plan generation. To support a mixed-initiative environment, we have developed user interactive capabilities in the Prodigy planning and learning system. We are also working towards the integration of the rationale-supported plan reuse in Prodigy/Analogy with the plan retrieval and modification tools of ForMAT. Finally, we have focused on the user's input into the process of plan reuse, in particular when conditional planning is needed. ",0
"Title: Incremental methods for computing bounds in partially observable Markov decision processes  
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) allow one to model complex dynamic decision or control problems that include both action outcome uncertainty and imperfect observabil-ity. The control problem is formulated as a dynamic optimization problem with a value function combining costs or rewards from multiple steps. In this paper we propose, analyse and test various incremental methods for computing bounds on the value function for control problems with infinite discounted horizon criteria. The methods described and tested include novel incremental versions of grid-based linear interpolation method and simple lower bound method with Sondik's updates. Both of these can work with arbitrary points of the belief space and can be enhanced by various heuristic point selection strategies. Also introduced is a new method for computing an initial upper bound the fast informed bound method. This method is able to improve significantly on the standard and commonly used upper bound computed by the MDP-based method. The quality of resulting bounds are tested on a maze navigation problem with 20 states, 6 actions and 8 observations.

Harvey, eds., MIT Press. pp 358-367. knowledge into the program, which would result in familiar structures, we provided the algorithm with a model of the physical reality and a purely utilitarian fitness function, thus supplying measures of feasibility and functionality. In this way the evolutionary process runs in an environment that has not been unnecessarily constrained. We added, however, a requirement of computability to reject overly complex structures when they took too long for our simulations to evaluate. The results are encouraging. The evolved structures had a surprisingly alien look: they are not based in common knowledge on how to build with brick toys; instead, the computer found ways of its own through the evolutionary search process. We were able to assemble the final designs manually and confirm that they accomplish the objectives introduced with our fitness functions. After some background on related problems, we describe our physical simulation model for two-dimensional Lego structures, and the representation for encoding them and applying evolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of our work with photos of actual objects which were the result of particular optimizations. Finally, we discuss future work and draw some conclusions. In order to evolve both the morphology and behavior of autonomous mechanical devices which can be manufactured, one must have a simulator which operates under several constraints, and a resultant controller which is adaptive enough to cover the gap between simulated and real world. eral space of mechanisms. Conservative - because simulation is never perfect, it should preserve a margin of safety. Efficient - it should be quicker to test in simulation than through physical production and test. Buildable - results should be convertible from a simula tion to a real object Computer Evolution of Buildable Objects Abstract The idea of co-evolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has been constrained by the reality gap which implies that resultant objects are usually not buildable. The work we present takes a step in the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of parts. Evolution takes place in a simulator we designed, which computes forces and stresses and predicts failure for 2-dimensional Lego structures. The final printout of our program is a schematic assembly, which can then be built physically. We demonstrate its functionality in several different evolved entities.",0
"Title: A General Lower Bound on the Number of Examples Needed for Learning  
Abstract: We prove a lower bound of ( 1 * ln 1 ffi + VCdim(C) * ) on the number of random examples required for distribution-free learning of a concept class C, where VCdim(C) is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and * and ffi are the accuracy and confidence parameters. This improves the previous best lower bound of ( 1 * ln 1 ffi + VCdim(C)), and comes close to the known general upper bound of O( 1 ffi + VCdim(C) * ln 1 * ) for consistent algorithms. We show that for many interesting concept classes, including kCNF and kDNF, our bound is actually tight to within a constant factor. ","Title: CBR for Document Retrieval: The FAllQ Project

"Title: Analyzing Social Network Structures in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with Choice and Refusal  
Abstract: University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Computer Sciences Technical Report CS-TR-94-1259 Abstract The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with Choice and Refusal (IPD/CR) [46] is an extension of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with evolution that allows players to choose and to refuse their game partners. From individual behaviors, behavioral population structures emerge. In this report, we examine one particular IPD/CR environment and document the social network methods used to identify population behaviors found within this complex adaptive system. In contrast to the standard homogeneous population of nice cooperators, we have also found metastable populations of mixed strategies within this environment. In particular, the social networks of interesting populations and their evolution are examined.","Title: Using Precepts to Augment Training Set Learning an input whose value is don't-care in some
Abstract: are used in turn to approximate A. Empirical studies show that good results can be achieved with TSL [8, 11]. However, TSL has several drawbacks. Training set learners (e.g., backpropagation) are typically slow as they may require many passes over the training set. Also, there is no guarantee that, given an arbitrary training set, the system will find enough good critical features to get a reasonable approximation of A. Moreover, the number of features to be searched is exponential in the number of inputs, and TSL becomes computationally expensive [1]. Finally, the scarcity of interesting positive theoretical results suggests the difficulty of learning without sufficient a priori knowledge. The goal of learning systems is to generalize. Generalization is commonly based on the set of critical features the system has available. Training set learners typically extract critical features from a random set of examples. While this approach is attractive, it suffers from the exponential growth of the number of features to be searched. We propose to extend it by endowing the system with some a priori knowledge, in the form of precepts. Advantages of the augmented system are speedup, improved generalization, and greater parsimony. This paper presents a precept-driven learning algorithm. Its main features include: 1) distributed implementation, 2) bounded learning and execution times, and 3) ability to handle both correct and incorrect precepts. Results of simulations on real-world data demonstrate promise. This paper presents precept-driven learning (PDL). PDL is intended to overcome some of TSL's weaknesses. In PDL, the training set is augmented by a small set of precepts. A pair p = (i, o) in I O is called an example. A precept is an example in which some of the i-entries (inputs) are set to the special value don't-care. An input whose value is not don't-care is said to be asserted. If i has no effect on the value of the output. The use of the special value don't-care is therefore as a shorthand. A pair containing don't-care inputs represents as many examples as the product of the sizes of the input domains of its don't-care inputs. 1. Introduction ",0
"Title: Crossover or Mutation?  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms rely on two genetic operators crossover and mutation. Although there exists a large body of conventional wisdom concerning the roles of crossover and mutation, these roles have not been captured in a theoretical fashion. For example, it has never been theoretically shown that mutation is in some sense ""less powerful"" than crossover or vice versa. This paper provides some answers to these questions by theoretically demonstrating that there are some important characteristics of each operator that are not captured by the other.","Title: In  Improving Elevator Performance Using Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most RL research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.",0
"Title: Looking at Markov Samplers through Cusum Path Plots: a simple diagnostic idea  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to monitor a Markov chain sampler using the cusum path plot of a chosen 1-dimensional summary statistic. We argue that the cusum path plot can bring out, more effectively than the sequential plot, those aspects of a Markov sampler which tell the user how quickly or slowly the sampler is moving around in its sample space, in the direction of the summary statistic. The proposal is then illustrated in four examples which represent situations where the cusum path plot works well and not well. Moreover, a rigorous analysis is given for one of the examples. We conclude that the cusum path plot is an effective tool for convergence diagnostics of a Markov sampler and for comparing different Markov samplers.

Abstract: Many of the lower-level areas in the mammalian visual system are organized retinotopically, that is, as maps which preserve to a certain degree the topography of the retina. A unit that is a part of such a retinotopic map normally responds selectively to stimulation in a well-delimited part of the visual field, referred to as its receptive field (RF). Receptive fields are probably the most prominent and ubiquitous computational mechanism employed by biological information processing systems. This paper surveys some of the possible computational reasons behind the ubiquity of RFs, by discussing examples of RF-based solutions to problems in vision, from spatial acuity, through sensory coding, to object recognition. fl Weizmann Institute CS-TR 95-29, 1995; to appear in Vision, R.

We then offer evidence that machine learning can help to build a dispatching method that will perform better than the system currently in place.",0
"Title: Transfer of Learning by Composing Solutions of Elemental Sequential Tasks  
Abstract: Although building sophisticated learning agents that operate in complex environments will require learning to perform multiple tasks, most applications of reinforcement learning have focussed on single tasks. In this paper I consider a class of sequential decision tasks (SDTs), called composite sequential decision tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of elemental sequential decision tasks. Elemental SDTs cannot be decomposed into simpler SDTs. I consider a learning agent that has to learn to solve a set of elemental and composite SDTs. I assume that the structure of the composite tasks is unknown to the learning agent. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks requires learning the tasks separately, which can waste computational resources, both memory and time. I present a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that learns the decomposition of composite SDTs, and achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The solution of a composite SDT is constructed by computationally inexpensive modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental SDTs. I provide a proof of one aspect of the learning algorithm. ","Title: SEMILINEAR PREDICTABILITY MINIMIZATION PRODUCES WELL-KNOWN FEATURE DETECTORS Neural Computation, 1996 (accepted)

So far, however, there were only toy applications of PM. In this paper, we apply semilinear PM to static real world images and find: without a teacher and without any significant preprocessing, the system automatically learns to generate distributed representations based on well-known feature detectors, such as orientation sensitive edge detectors and off-center-on-surround-like structures, thus extracting simple features related to those considered useful for image pre-processing and compression.",0
"Title: A Case Study of Case-Based CBR  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning depends on multiple knowledge sources beyond the case library, including knowledge about case adaptation and criteria for similarity assessment. Because hand coding this knowledge accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. However, despite early interest in case-based approaches to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require, and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources. The paper closes with general lessons about case-based CBR and areas for future research.","Title: A VLSI Implementation of a Parallel, Self-Organizing Learning Model

"Title: In Search Of Articulated Attractors  
Abstract: Recurrent attractor networks offer many advantages over feed-forward networks for the modeling of psychological phenomena. Their dynamic nature allows them to capture the time course of cognitive processing, and their learned weights may often be easily interpreted as soft constraints between representational components. Perhaps the most significant feature of such networks, however, is their ability to facilitate generalization by enforcing well formedness constraints on intermediate and output representations. Attractor networks which learn the systematic regularities of well formed representations by exposure to a small number of examples are said to possess articulated attractors. This paper investigates the conditions under which articulated attractors arise in recurrent networks trained using variants of backpropagation. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that such structured attrac-tors can spontaneously appear in an emergence of systematic-ity, if an appropriate error signal is presented directly to the recurrent processing elements. We show, however, that distal error signals, backpropagated through intervening weights, pose serious problems for networks of this kind. We present simulation results, discuss the reasons for this difficulty, and suggest some directions for future attempts to surmount it.

Abstract: A distinction between two forms of task knowledge transfer, representational and functional, is reviewed followed by a discussion of MTL, a modified version of the multiple task learning (MTL) neural network method of functional transfer.

An MTL network is applied to a diagnostic domain of four levels of coronary artery disease. Results of experiments demonstrate the ability of MTL to develop a predictive model for one level of disease which has superior diagnostic ability over models produced by either single task learning or standard multiple task learning.

"Title: Adaptive Boosting of Neural Networks for Character Recognition  
Abstract: Technical Report #1072, D epartement d'Informatique et Recherche Op erationnelle, Universit e de Montr eal Abstract Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], in particular decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks applied to character recognition tasks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 2% error on the UCI Letters offline characters data set.","Title: The Role of Constraints in Hebbian Learning  
Abstract: Models of unsupervised correlation-based (Hebbian) synaptic plasticity are typically unstable: either all synapses grow until each reaches the maximum allowed strength, or all synapses decay to zero strength. A common method of avoiding these outcomes is to use a constraint that conserves or limits the total synaptic strength over a cell. We study the dynamical effects of such constraints. Two methods of enforcing a constraint are distinguished, multiplicative and subtractive. For otherwise linear learning rules, multiplicative enforcement of a constraint results in dynamics that converge to the principal eigenvector of the operator determining unconstrained synaptic development. Subtractive enforcement, in contrast, typically leads to a final state in which almost all synaptic strengths reach either the maximum or minimum allowed value. This final state is often dominated by weight configurations other than the principal eigenvector of the unconstrained operator. Multiplicative enforcement yields a ""graded"" receptive field in which most mutually correlated inputs are represented, whereas subtractive enforcement yields a receptive field that is ""sharpened"" to a subset of maximally-correlated inputs. If two equivalent input populations (e.g. two eyes) innervate a common target, multiplicative enforcement prevents their segregation (ocular dominance segregation) when the two populations are weakly correlated; whereas subtractive enforcement allows segregation under these circumstances. These results may be used to understand constraints both over output cells and over input cells. A variety of rules that can implement constrained dynamics are discussed.",0
"Title: Evaluating Computational Assistance for Crisis Response  
Abstract: In this paper we examine the behavior of a human-computer system for crisis response. As one instance of crisis management, we describe the task of responding to spills and fires involving hazardous materials. We then describe INCA, an intelligent assistant for planning and scheduling in this domain, and its relation to human users. We focus on INCA's strategy of retrieving a case from a case library, seeding the initial schedule, and then helping the user adapt this seed. We also present three hypotheses about the behavior of this mixed-initiative system and some experiments designed to test them. The results suggest that our approach leads to faster response development than user-generated or automatically-generated schedules but without sacrificing solution quality. ","Title: Space-Time Scheduling of Instruction-Level Parallelism on a Raw Machine  
Abstract: Advances in VLSI technology will enable chips with over a billion transistors within the next decade. Unfortunately, the centralized-resource architectures of modern microprocessors are ill-suited to exploit such advances. Achieving a high level of parallelism at a reasonable clock speed requires distributing the processor resources a trend already visible in the dual-register-file architecture of the Alpha 21264. A Raw microprocessor takes an extreme position in this space by distributing all its resources such as instruction streams, register files, memory ports, and ALUs over a pipelined two-dimensional interconnect, and exposing them fully to the compiler. Compilation for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) on such distributed-resource machines requires both spatial instruction scheduling and traditional temporal instruction scheduling. This paper describes the techniques used by the Raw compiler to handle these issues. Preliminary results from a SUIF-based compiler for sequential programs written in C and Fortran indicate that the Raw approach to exploiting ILP can achieve speedups scalable with the number of processors for applications with such parallelism. The Raw architecture attempts to provide performance that is at least comparable to that provided by scaling an existing architecture, but that can achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance for applications with a large amount of parallelism. This paper offers some positive results in this direction. ",0
"Title: Use of Methodological Diversity to Improve Neural Network Generalisation  
Abstract: Littlewood and Miller [1989] present a statistical framework for dealing with coincident failures in multiversion software systems. They develop a theoretical model that holds the promise of high system reliability through the use of multiple, diverse sets of alternative versions. In this paper we adapt their framework to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the diversity observable in multiple populations of neural networks developed using diverse methodologies. We evaluate the generalisation improvements achieved by a range of methodologically diverse network generation processes. We attempt to order the constituent methodological features with respect to their potential for use in the engineering of useful diversity. We also define and explore the use of relative measures of the diversity between version sets as a guide to the potential for exploiting inter-set diversity. ","Title: Convergence-Zone Episodic Memory: Analysis and Simulations  
Abstract: Human episodic memory provides a seemingly unlimited storage for everyday experiences, and a retrieval system that allows us to access the experiences with partial activation of their components. The system is believed to consist of a fast, temporary storage in the hippocampus, and a slow, long-term storage within the neocortex. This paper presents a neural network model of the hippocampal episodic memory inspired by Damasio's idea of Convergence Zones. The model consists of a layer of perceptual feature maps and a binding layer. A perceptual feature pattern is coarse coded in the binding layer, and stored on the weights between layers. A partial activation of the stored features activates the binding pattern, which in turn reactivates the entire stored pattern. For many configurations of the model, a theoretical lower bound for the memory capacity can be derived, and it can be an order of magnitude or higher than the number of all units in the model, and several orders of magnitude higher than the number of binding-layer units. Computational simulations further indicate that the average capacity is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical lower bound, and making the connectivity between layers sparser causes an even further increase in capacity. Simulations also show that if more descriptive binding patterns are used, the errors tend to be more plausible (patterns are confused with other similar patterns), with a slight cost in capacity. The convergence-zone episodic memory therefore accounts for the immediate storage and associative retrieval capability and large capacity of the hippocampal memory, and shows why the memory encoding areas can be much smaller than the perceptual maps, consist of rather coarse computational units, and be only sparsely connected to the perceptual maps.

"Title: Towards Automatic Discovery of Building Blocks in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for the discovery of building blocks in genetic programming (GP) called adaptive representation through learning (ARL). The central idea of ARL is the adaptation of the problem representation, by extending the set of terminals and functions with a set of evolvable subroutines. The set of subroutines extracts common knowledge emerging during the evolutionary process and acquires the necessary structure for solving the problem. ARL supports subroutine creation and deletion. Subroutine creation or discovery is performed automatically based on the differential parent-offspring fitness and block activation. Subroutine deletion relies on a utility measure similar to schema fitness over a window of past generations. The technique described is tested on the problem of controlling an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment. The automatic discovery of subroutines can help scale up the GP technique to complex problems. ","Title: Corporate Memories as Distributed Case Libraries

In this paper, we discuss how viewing corporate memories as distributed case libraries can benefit from existing techniques for distributed case-based reasoning for resource discovery and exploitation of previous expertise. We present two techniques developed in the context of multi-agent case-based reasoning for accessing and exploiting past experience from corporate memory resources. The first approach, called Negotiated Retrieval, deals with retrieving and assembling ""case pieces"" from different resources in a corporate memory to form a good overall case. The second approach, based on Federated Peer Learning, deals with two modes of cooperation called DistCBR and ColCBR that let an agent exploit the experience and expertise of peer agents to achieve a local task. fl The first author would like to acknowledge the support by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

"Title: Generalizing in TD() learning  
Abstract: Previous research has shown that a technique called error-correcting output coding (ECOC) can dramatically improve the classification accuracy of supervised learning algorithms that learn to classify data points into one of k 2 classes. In this paper, we will extend the technique so that ECOC can also provide class probability information. ECOC is a method of converting k-class supervised learning problem into a large number L of two-class supervised learning problems and then combining the results of these L evaluations. The underlying two-class supervised learning algorithms are assumed to provide L probability estimates. The problem of computing class probabilities is formulated as an over-constrained system of L linear equations. Least squares methods are applied to solve these equations. Accuracy and reliability of the probability estimates are demonstrated.","Title: Cross-Validation and the Bootstrap: Estimating the Error Rate of a Prediction Rule  
Abstract: A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased, but can be highly variable. This article discusses bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. A particular bootstrap method, the 632+ rule, is shown to substantially outperform cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric, and apply to any possible prediction rule: however we only study classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include ""smooth"" prediction rules like Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function, and unsmooth ones like Nearest Neighbors.",0

Abstract:  ","Title: MDL Learning of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Discrete Problem Domains  
Abstract: Given a problem, a case-based reasoning (CBR) system will search its case memory and use the stored cases to find the solution, possibly modifying retrieved cases to adapt to the required input specifications. In discrete domains CBR reasoning can be based on a rigorous Bayesian probability propagation algorithm. Such a Bayesian CBR system can be implemented as a probabilistic feedforward neural network with one of the layers representing the cases. In this paper we introduce a Minimum Description Length (MDL) based learning algorithm to obtain the proper network structure with the associated conditional probabilities. This algorithm together with the resulting neural network implementation provide a massively parallel architecture for solving the efficiency bottleneck in case-based reasoning. ",0
"Title: Evaluation of Pattern Classifiers for Fingerprint and OCR Applications  
Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the classification accuracy of four statistical and three neural network classifiers for two image based pattern classification problems. These are fingerprint classification and optical character recognition (OCR) for isolated handprinted digits. The evaluation results reported here should be useful for designers of practical systems for these two important commercial applications. For the OCR problem, the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform of the images is used to generate the input feature set. Similarly for the fingerprint problem, the K-L transform of the ridge directions is used to generate the input feature set. The statistical classifiers used were Euclidean minimum distance, quadratic minimum distance, normal, and k-nearest neighbor. The neural network classifiers used were multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, and probabilistic. The OCR data consisted of 7,480 digit images for training and 23,140 digit images for testing. The fingerprint data consisted of 2,000 training and 2,000 testing images. In addition to evaluation for accuracy, the multilayer perceptron and radial basis function networks were evaluated for size and generalization capability. For the evaluated datasets the best accuracy obtained for either problem was provided by the probabilistic neural network, where the minimum classification error was 2.5% for OCR and 7.2% for fingerprints. ","Title: ADAPTIVE TESTING OF CONTROLLERS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES  
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to maintain vehicle performance in the presence of vehicle faults. The test and evaluation of complex software controllers is expected to be a challenging task. The goal of this e ffort is to apply machine learning techniques from the field of arti ficial intelligence to the general problem of evaluating an intelligent controller for an autonomous vehicle. The approach involves subjecting a controller to an adaptively chosen set of fault scenarios within a vehicle simulator, and searching for combinations of faults that produce noteworthy performance by the vehicle controller. The search employs a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the approach by evaluating the performance of a subsumption-based controller for an autonomous vehicle. The preliminary evidence suggests that this approach is an e ffective alternative to manual testing of sophisticated software controllers. ",0
"Title: EE380L:Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition  POp Trees  under the guidance of  
Abstract: Decision Trees have been widely used for classification/regression tasks. They are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks and are understandable by humans. In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree.","Title: APPLICATIONS OF CHEEGER'S CONSTANT TO THE CONVERGENCE RATE OF MARKOV CHAINS ON R n

"Title: Task Selection for a Multiscalar Processor  
Abstract: The Multiscalar architecture advocates a distributed processor organization and task-level speculation to exploit high degrees of instruction level parallelism (ILP) in sequential programs without impeding improvements in clock speeds. The main goal of this paper is to understand the key implications of the architectural features of distributed processor organization and task-level speculation for compiler task selection from the point of view of performance. We identify the fundamental performance issues to be: control ow speculation, data communication, data dependence speculation, load imbalance, and task overhead. We show that these issues are intimately related to a few key characteristics of tasks: task size, inter-task control ow, and inter-task data dependence. We describe compiler heuristics to select tasks with favorable characteristics. We report experimental results to show that the heuristics are successful in boosting overall performance by establishing larger ILP windows. ","Title: Sequential PAC Learning  
Abstract: We consider the use of ""on-line"" stopping rules to reduce the number of training examples needed to pac-learn. Rather than collect a large training sample that can be proved sufficient to eliminate all bad hypotheses a priori, the idea is instead to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide ""on-line"" whether to stop and return a hypothesis, or continue training. The primary benefit of this approach is that we can detect when a hypothesizer has actually ""converged,"" and halt training before the standard fixed-sample-size bounds. This paper presents a series of such sequential learning procedures for: distribution-free pac-learning, ""mistake-bounded to pac"" conversion, and distribution-specific pac-learning, respectively. We analyze the worst case expected training sample size of these procedures, and show that this is often smaller than existing fixed sample size bounds | while providing the exact same worst case pac-guarantees. We also provide lower bounds that show these reductions can at best involve constant (and possibly log) factors. However, empirical studies show that these sequential learning procedures actually use many times fewer training examples in prac tice.",0

Abstract: The statistical query learning model can be viewed as a tool for creating (or demonstrating the existence of) noise-tolerant learning algorithms in the PAC model. The complexity of a statistical query algorithm, in conjunction with the complexity of simulating SQ algorithms in the PAC model with noise, determine the complexity of the noise-tolerant PAC algorithms produced. Although roughly optimal upper bounds have been shown for the complexity of statistical query learning, the corresponding noise-tolerant PAC algorithms are not optimal due to inefficient simulations. In this paper we provide both improved simulations and a new variant of the statistical query model in order to overcome these inefficiencies. We improve the time complexity of the classification noise simulation of statistical query algorithms. Our new simulation has a roughly optimal dependence on the noise rate. We also derive a simpler proof that statistical queries can be simulated in the presence of classification noise. This proof makes fewer assumptions on the queries themselves and therefore allows one to simulate more general types of queries. We also define a new variant of the statistical query model based on relative error, and we show that this variant is more natural and strictly more powerful than the standard additive error model. We demonstrate efficient PAC simulations for algorithms in this new model and give general upper bounds on both learning with relative error statistical queries and PAC simulation. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be simulated in the PAC model with malicious errors in such a way that the resultant PAC algorithm has a roughly optimal tolerable malicious error rate and sample complexity. Finally, we generalize the types of queries allowed in the statistical query model. We discuss the advantages of allowing these generalized queries and show that our results on improved simulations also hold for these queries.

"Title: Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem  
Abstract: We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.","Title: Mathematical Programming in Neural Networks

"Title: LEARNING LINEAR, SPARSE, FACTORIAL CODES  
Abstract: In previous work (Olshausen & Field 1996), an algorithm was described for learning linear sparse codes which, when trained on natural images, produces a set of basis functions that are spatially localized, oriented, and bandpass (i.e., wavelet-like). This note shows how the algorithm may be interpreted within a maximum-likelihood framework. Several useful insights emerge from this connection: it makes explicit the relation to statistical independence (i.e., factorial coding), it shows a formal relationship to the algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski (1995), and it suggests how to adapt parameters that were previously fixed.

","Title: Acquiring Recursive and Iterative Concepts with Explanation-Based Learning explanation-based generalization, generalizing explanation structures, generalizing to
Abstract: University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Technical Report 876 (September 1989) Abstract In explanation-based learning, a specific problem's solution is generalized into a form that can be later used to solve conceptually similar problems. Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning. ",0

Abstract: In this paper we show that the posterior distribution for feedforward neural networks is asymptotically consistent. This paper extends earlier results on universal approximation properties of neural networks to the Bayesian setting. The proof of consistency embeds the problem in a density estimation problem, then uses bounds on the bracketing entropy to show that the posterior is consistent over Hellinger neighborhoods. It then relates this result back to the regression setting. We show consistency in both the setting of the number of hidden nodes growing with the sample size, and in the case where the number of hidden nodes is treated as a parameter. Thus we provide a theoretical justification for using neural networks for nonparametric regression in a Bayesian framework. ",0
"Title: Efficient Visual Search: A Connectionist Solution  
Abstract: Searching for objects in scenes is a natural task for people and has been extensively studied by psychologists. In this paper we examine this task from a connectionist perspective. Computational complexity arguments suggest that parallel feed-forward networks cannot perform this task efficiently. One difficulty is that, in order to distinguish the target from distractors, a combination of features must be associated with a single object. Often called the binding problem, this requirement presents a serious hurdle for connectionist models of visual processing when multiple objects are present. Psychophysical experiments suggest that people use covert visual attention to get around this problem. In this paper we describe a psychologically plausible system which uses a focus of attention mechanism to locate target objects. A strategy that combines top-down and bottom-up information is used to minimize search time. The behavior of the resulting system matches the reaction time behavior of people in several interesting tasks. ","Title: Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Relevant Features  
Abstract: This paper describes efficient methods for exact and approximate implementation of the MIN-FEATURES bias, which prefers consistent hypotheses definable over as few features as possible. This bias is useful for learning domains where many irrelevant features are present in the training data. We first introduce FOCUS-2, a new algorithm that exactly implements the MIN-FEATURES bias. This algorithm is empirically shown to be substantially faster than the FOCUS algorithm previously given in [ Al-muallim and Dietterich, 1991 ] . We then introduce the Mutual-Information-Greedy, Simple-Greedy and Weighted-Greedy algorithms, which apply efficient heuristics for approximating the MIN-FEATURES bias. These algorithms employ greedy heuristics that trade optimality for computational efficiency. Experimental studies show that the learning performance of ID3 is greatly improved when these algorithms are used to preprocess the training data by eliminating the irrelevant features from ID3's consideration. In particular, the Weighted-Greedy algorithm provides an excellent and efficient approximation of the MIN ",0
"Title: Information Processing in Primate Retinal Cone Pathways: A Model  
Abstract: In the framework of a functional response model (i.e. a regression model, or a feedforward neural network) an estimator of a nonlinear response function is constructed from a set of functional units. The parameters defining these functional units are estimated using the Bayesian approach. A sample representing the Bayesian posterior distribution is obtained by applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure, namely the combination of Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. The method is described for histogram, B-spline and radial basis function estimators of a response function. In general, the proposed approach is suitable for finding Bayes-optimal values of parameters in a complicated parameter space. We illustrate the method on numerical examples.

A system that uses of portions of precedents for legal analysis in the domain of Texas worker's compensation law, GREBE, is described, and examples of GREBE's analysis that combine reasoning steps from multiple precedents are presented.

"Title: Real-time Interactive Neuro-evolution  
Abstract: In standard neuro-evolution, a population of networks is evolved in the task, and the network that best solves the task is found. This network is then fixed and used to solve future instances of the problem. Networks evolved in this way do not handle real-time interaction very well. It is hard to evolve a solution ahead of time that can cope effectively with all the possible environments that might arise in the future and with all the possible ways someone may interact with it. This paper proposes evolving feedforward neural networks online to create agents that improve their performance through real-time interaction. This approach is demonstrated in a game world where neural-network-controlled individuals play against humans. Through evolution, these individuals learn to react to varying opponents while appropriately taking into account conflicting goals. After initial evaluation offline, the population is allowed to evolve online, and its performance improves considerably. The population not only adapts to novel situations brought about by changing strategies in the opponent and the game layout, but it also improves its performance in situations that it has already seen in offline training. This paper will describe an implementation of online evolution and shows that it is a practical method that exceeds the performance of offline evolution alone.

Selection for a particular level of virulence can happen either at at the level of between-host tradeoffs or as a result of short-sighted within-host competition.

We show that the Simple Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve an optimization problem derived from the 3-Conjunctive Normal Form problem. By separating the populations into small sub-populations, parallel genetic algorithms exploits the inherent parallelism in genetic algorithms and prevents premature convergence. Genetic algorithms using hill-climbing conduct genetic search in the space of local optima, and hill-climbing can be less com-putationally expensive than genetic search.

"Title: Automated Decomposition of Model-based Learning Problems  
Abstract: A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed autonomous systems is being developed that has the potential for unprecedented performance, such as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a formalization of decompositional, model-based learning (DML), a method developed by observing a modeler's expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between learning and consistency-based diagnosis.

However, the experiments show as well that the use of this algorithm cannot be recommended for domains with a very specific concept description. ","Title: Cryptographic Limitations on Learning Boolean Formulae and Finite Automata  
Abstract: In this paper we prove the intractability of learning several classes of Boolean functions in the distribution-free model (also called the Probably Approximately Correct or PAC model) of learning from examples. These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography. We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a gener - alization of graph coloring. fl This research was conducted while the author was at Harvard University and supported by an A.T.& T.

"Title: WEAK CONVERGENCE AND OPTIMAL SCALING OF RANDOM WALK METROPOLIS ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm, in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. ","Title: Update rules for parameter estimation in Bayesian networks  
Abstract: This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian networks with missing values and hidden variables from the perspective of recent work in on-line learning [12]. We provide a unified framework for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, our framework encompasses both the gradient projection algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame ters than does standard EM.",0

Abstract: Adaptation of ecological systems to their environments is commonly viewed through some explicit fitness function defined a priori by the experimenter, or measured a posteriori by estimations based on population size and/or reproductive rates. These methods do not capture the role of environmental complexity in shaping the selective pressures that control the adaptive process. Ecological simulations enabled by computational tools such as the Latent Energy Environments (LEE) model allow us to characterize more closely the effects of environmental complexity on the evolution of adaptive behaviors. LEE is described in this paper. Its motivation arises from the need to vary complexity in controlled and predictable ways, without assuming the relationship of these changes to the adaptive behaviors they engender. This goal is achieved through a careful characterization of environments in which different forms of ""energy"" are well-defined. A genetic algorithm using endogenous fitness and local selection is used to model the evolutionary process. Individuals in the population are modeled by neural networks with simple sensory-motor systems, and variations in their behaviors are related to interactions with varying environments. We outline the results of three experiments that analyze different sources of environmental complexity and their effects on the collective behaviors of evolving populations. ",0
"Title: LEARNING ROBOT BEHAVIORS USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: Genetic Algorithms are used to learn navigation and collision avoidance behaviors for robots. The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the The approach to learning behaviors for robots described here reflects a particular methodology for learning via a simulation model. The motivation is that making mistakes on real systems may be costly or dangerous. In addition, time constraints might limit the number of experiences during learning in the real world, while in many cases, the simulation model can be made to run faster than real time. Since learning may require experimenting with behaviors that might occasionally produce unacceptable results if applied to the real world, or might require too much time in the real environment, we assume that hypothetical behaviors will be evaluated in a simulation model (the off-line system). As illustrated in Figure 1, the current best behavior can be placed in the real, on-line system, while learning continues in the off-line system [1]. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The expectation is that behaviors learned in these simulations will be useful in real-world environments. Previous studies have illustrated that knowledge learned under simulation is robust and might be applicable to the real world if the simulation is more general (i.e. has more noise, more varied conditions, etc.) than the real world environment [2]. Where this is not possible, it is important to identify the differences between the simulation and the world and note the effect upon the learning process. The research reported here continues to examine this hypothesis. The next section very briefly explains the learning algorithm (and gives pointers to where more extensive documentation can be found). After that, the actual robot is described. Then we describe the simulation of the robot. The task _______________ actual robot.","Title: An Interactive Planning Architecture The Forest Fire Fighting case

"Title: on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-95) Inducing Logic Programs without Explicit Negative Examples  
Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning logic programs without explicit negative examples by exploiting an assumption of output completeness. A mode declaration is supplied for the target predicate and each training input is assumed to be accompanied by all of its legal outputs. Any other outputs generated by an incomplete program implicitly represent negative examples; however, large numbers of ground negative examples never need to be generated. This method has been incorporated into two ILP systems, Chillin and IFoil, both of which use intensional background knowledge. Tests on two natural language acquisition tasks, case-role mapping and past-tense learning, illustrate the advantages of the approach. ","Title: Learning Recursive Sequences via Evolution of Machine-Language Programs  
Abstract: We use directed search techniques in the space of computer programs to learn recursive sequences of positive integers. Specifically, the integer sequences of squares, x 2 ; cubes, x 3 ; factorial, x!; and Fibonacci numbers are studied. Given a small finite prefix of a sequence, we show that three directed searches|machine-language genetic programming with crossover, exhaustive iterative hill climbing, and a hybrid (crossover and hill climbing)|can automatically discover programs that exactly reproduce the finite target prefix and, moreover, that correctly produce the remaining sequence up to the underlying machine's precision. Our machine-language representation is generic|it contains instructions for arithmetic, register manipulation and comparison, and control flow. We also introduce an output instruction that allows variable-length sequences as result values. Importantly, this representation does not contain recursive operators; recursion, when needed, is automatically synthesized from primitive instructions. For a fixed set of search parameters (e.g., instruction set, program size, fitness criteria), we compare the efficiencies of the three directed search techniques on the four sequence problems. For this parameter set, an evolutionary-based search always outperforms exhaustive hill climbing as well as undirected random search. Since only the prefix of the target sequence is variable in our experiments, we posit that this approach to sequence induction is potentially quite general. ",0

There are many methods for probability modeling, but few for learning utility and decision models. We use reinforcement learning to find the optimal sequence of questions in a diagnosis situation while maintaining a high accuracy. Automated diagnosis on a heart-disease domain is used to demonstrate that temporal-difference learning can improve diagnosis. On the Cleveland heart-disease database our results are better than those reported from all previous methods. ",0
"Title: Estimating Bayes Factors via Posterior Simulation with the Laplace-Metropolis Estimator  
Abstract: The key quantity needed for Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection is the marginal likelihood for a model, also known as the integrated likelihood, or the marginal probability of the data. In this paper we describe a way to use posterior simulation output to estimate marginal likelihoods. We describe the basic Laplace-Metropolis estimator for models without random effects. For models with random effects the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator is introduced. This estimator is applied to data from the World Fertility Survey and shown to give accurate results. Batching of simulation output is used to assess the uncertainty involved in using the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator. The method allows us to test for the effects of independent variables in a random effects model, and also to test for the presence of the random effects.","Title: One-unit Learning Rules for Independent Component Analysis

The learning rules use very simple constrained Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning in which decorrelating feedback may be added. To speed up the convergence of these stochastic gradient descent rules, a novel com putationally ecient txed-point algorithm is introduced.",0

"Title: Learning Monitoring Strategies: A Difficult Genetic Programming Application  
Abstract: Finding optimal or at least good monitoring strategies is an important consideration when designing an agent. We have applied genetic programming to this task, with mixed results. Since the agent control language was kept purposefully general, the set of monitoring strategies constitutes only a small part of the overall space of possible behaviors. Because of this, it was often difficult for the genetic algorithm to evolve them, even though their performance was superior. These results raise questions as to how easy it will be for genetic programming to scale up as the areas it is applied to become more complex. ","Title: Robust Parameter Learning in Bayesian Networks with Missing Data  
Abstract: There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing ""module"" could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified.

"Title: Integrity Constraints in ILP using a Monte Carlo approach  
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art ILP systems require large numbers of negative examples to avoid overgeneralization. This is a considerable disadvantage for many ILP applications, namely indu ctive program synthesis where relativelly small and sparse example sets are a more realistic scenario. Integrity constraints are first order clauses that can play the role of negative examples in an inductive process. One integrity constraint can replace a long list of ground negative examples. However, checking the consistency of a program with a set of integrity constraints usually involves heavy the orem-proving. We propose an efficient constraint satisfaction algorithm that applies to a wide variety of useful integrity constraints and uses a Monte Carlo strategy. It looks for inconsistencies by ra ndom generation of queries to the program. This method allows the use of integrity constraints instead of (or together with) negative examples. As a consequence programs to induce can be specified more rapidly by the user and the ILP system tends to obtain more accurate definitions. Average running times are not greatly affected by the use of integrity constraints compared to ground negative examples. ","Title: Towards Robust Model Selection using Estimation and Approximation Error Bounds  
Abstract: Let us present briefly the learning problem we will address in this chapter and the following. The ultimate goal is the modelling of a mapping f : x 7! y from multidimensional input x to output y. The output can be multi-dimensional, but we will mostly address situations where it is a one dimensional real value. Furthermore, we should take into account the fact that we scarcely ever observe the actual true mapping y = f (x). This is due to perturbations such as e.g. observational noise. We will rather have a joint probability p (x; y). We expect this probability to be peaked for values of x and y corresponding to the mapping. We focus on automatic learning by example. A set D = of data sampled from the joint distribution p (x; y) = p (yjx) p (x) is collected. With the help of this set, we try to identify a model of the data, parameterised by a set of 1.2 Learning and optimisation The fit of the model to the system in a given point x is measured using a criterion representing the distance from the model prediction b y to the system, e (y; f w (x)).

"Title: On Learning Multiple Descriptions of a Concept  
Abstract: In sparse data environments, greater classification accuracy can be achieved by learning several concept descriptions of the data and combining their classifications. Stochastic search is a general tool which can be used to generate many good concept descriptions (rule sets) for each class in the data. Bayesian probability theory offers an optimal strategy for combining classifications of the individual concept descriptions, and here we use an approximation of that theory. This strategy is most useful when additional data is difficult to obtain and every increase in classification accuracy is important. The primary result of this paper is that multiple concept descriptions are particularly helpful in ""flat"" hypothesis spaces in which there are many equally good ways to grow a rule, each having similar gain. Another result is experimental evidence that learning multiple rule sets yields more accurate classifications than learning multiple rules for some domains. To demonstrate these behaviors, we learn multiple concept descriptions by adapting HYDRA, a noise-tolerant relational learning algorithm. ","Title: A Sequential Niche Technique for Multimodal Function Optimization  
Abstract: c fl UWCC COMMA Technical Report No. 93001, February 1993 x No part of this article may be reproduced for commercial purposes. Abstract A technique is described which allows unimodal function optimization methods to be extended to efficiently locate all optima of multimodal problems. We describe an algorithm based on a traditional genetic algorithm (GA). This involves iterating the GA, but uses knowledge gained during one iteration to avoid re-searching, on subsequent iterations, regions of problem space where solutions have already been found. This is achieved by applying a fitness derating function to the raw fitness function, so that fitness values are depressed in the regions of the problem space where solutions have already been found. Consequently, the likelihood of discovering a new solution on each iteration is dramatically increased. The technique may be used with various styles of GA, or with other optimization methods, such as simulated annealing. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of multimodal test functions. The technique is at least as fast as fitness sharing methods. It provides a speedup of between 1 and 10p on a problem with p optima, depending on the value of p and the convergence time complexity. ",0
"Title: Learning Curve Bounds for Markov Decision Processes with Undiscounted Rewards  
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) with undis-counted rewards represent an important class of problems in decision and control. The goal of learning in these MDPs is to find a policy that yields the maximum expected return per unit time. In large state spaces, computing these averages directly is not feasible; instead, the agent must estimate them by stochastic exploration of the state space. In this case, longer exploration times enable more accurate estimates and more informed decision-making. The learning curve for an MDP measures how the agent's performance depends on the allowed exploration time, T . In this paper we analyze these learning curves for a simple control problem with undiscounted rewards. In particular, methods from statistical mechanics are used to calculate lower bounds on the agent's performance in the thermodynamic limit T ! 1, N ! 1, ff = T =N (finite), where T is the number of time steps allotted per policy evaluation and N is the size of the state space. In this limit, we provide a lower bound on the return of policies that appear optimal based on imperfect statistics.","Title: Capacity of SDM

"Title: 3 Representation Issues in Neighborhood Search and Evolutionary Algorithms  
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms are often presented as general purpose search methods. Yet, we also know that no search method is better than another over all possible problems and that in fact there is often a good deal of problem specific information involved in the choice of problem representation and search operators. In this paper we explore some very general properties of representations as they relate to neighborhood search methods. In particular, we looked at the expected number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator when averaged overall possible representations. The number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator for standard Binary and standard binary reflected Gray codes is developed and explored as one measure of problem complexity. We also relate number of local optima to another metric, , designed to provide one measure of complexity with respect to a simple genetic algorithm. Choosing a good representation is a vital component of solving any search problem. However, choosing a good representation for a problem is as difficult as choosing a good search algorithm for a problem. Wolpert and Macready's (1995) No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem proves that no search algorithm is better than any other over all possible discrete functions. Radcliffe and Surry (1995) extend these notions to also cover the idea that all representations are equivalent when their behavior is considered on average over all possible functions. To understand these results, we first outline some of the simple assumptions behind this theorem. First, assume the optimization problem is discrete; this describes all combinatorial optimization problems-and really all optimization problems being solved on computers since computers have finite precision. Second, we ignore the fact that we can resample points in the space. The ""No Free Lunch"" result can be stated as follows: ","Title: A utility-based approach to learning in a mixed Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning architecture  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used as a form of ""caching"" solved problems to speedup later problem solving. Using ""cached"" cases brings additional costs with it due to retrieval time, case adaptation time and also storage space. Simply storing all cases will result in a situation in which retrieving and trying to adapt old cases will take more time (on average) than not caching at all. This means that caching must be applied selectively to build a case memory that is actually useful. This is a form of the utility problem [4, 2]. The approach taken here is to construct a ""cost model"" of a system that can be used to predict the effect of changes to the system. In this paper we describe the utility problem associated with ""caching"" cases and the construction of a ""cost model"". We present experimental results that demonstrate that the model can be used to predict the effect of certain changes to the case memory.",0
"Title: A Quantitative Study of Experimental Evaluations of Neural Network Learning Algorithms: Current Research Practice  
Abstract: 190 articles about neural network learning algorithms published in 1993 and 1994 are examined for the amount of experimental evaluation they contain. 29% of them employ not even a single realistic or real learning problem. Only 8% of the articles present results for more than one problem using real world data. Furthermore, one third of all articles do not present any quantitative comparison with a previously known algorithm. These results suggest that we should strive for better assessment practices in neural network learning algorithm research. For the long-term benefit of the field, the publication standards should be raised in this respect and easily accessible collections of benchmark problems should be built. ","Title: A Simple Neural Network Models Categorical Perception of Facial Expressions  
Abstract: The performance of a neural network that categorizes facial expressions is compared with human subjects over a set of experiments using interpolated imagery. The experiments for both the human subjects and neural networks make use of interpolations of facial expressions from the Pictures of Facial Affect Database [Ekman and Friesen, 1976]. The only difference in materials between those used in the human subjects experiments [Young et al., 1997] and our materials are the manner in which the interpolated images are constructed - image-quality morphs versus pixel averages. Nevertheless, the neural network accurately captures the categorical nature of the human responses, showing sharp transitions in labeling of images along the interpolated sequence. Crucially for a demonstration of categorical perception [Harnad, 1987], the model shows the highest discrimination between transition images at the crossover point. The model also captures the shape of the reaction time curves of the human subjects along the sequences. Finally, the network matches human subjects' judgements of which expressions are being mixed in the images. The main failing of the model is that there are intrusions of neutral responses in some transitions, which are not seen in the human subjects. We attribute this difference to the difference between the pixel average stimuli and the image quality morph stimuli. These results show that a simple neural network classifier, with no access to the biological constraints that are presumably imposed on the human emotion processor, and whose only access to the surrounding culture is the category labels placed by American subjects on the facial expressions, can nevertheless simulate fairly well the human responses to emotional expressions.

"Title: A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies  
Abstract: Numerical design optimization algorithms are highly sensitive to the particular formulation of the optimization problems they are given. The formulation of the search space, the objective function and the constraints will generally have a large impact on the duration of the optimization process as well as the quality of the resulting design. Furthermore, the best formulation will vary from one application domain to another, and from one problem to another within a given application domain. Unfortunately, a design engineer may not know the best formulation in advance of attempting to set up and run a design optimization process. In order to attack this problem, we have developed a software environment that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system represents optimization strategies in terms of second-order dataflow graphs. Reformulations of strategies are implemented as transformations between dataflow graphs. The system permits the user to interactively generate and search a space of design optimization strategies, and experimentally evaluate their performance on test problems, in order to find a strategy that is suitable for his application domain. The system has been implemented in a domain independent fashion, and is being tested in the domain of racing yacht design.

By letting neural plasticity mediate the competitive interaction instead, we obtain diffuse, nonadaptive alternatives for fully distributed representations. We use this technique to simplify and improve our binary information gain optimization algorithm for feature extraction (Schraudolph and Sejnowski, 1993); the same approach could be used to improve other learning algorithms.",0

Abstract: Genetic Programming (GP) uses variable size representations as programs. Size becomes an important and interesting emergent property of the structures evolved by GP. The size of programs can be both a controlling and a controlled factor in GP search. Size influences the efficiency of the search process and is related to the generality of solutions. This paper analyzes the size and generality issues in standard GP and GP using subroutines and addresses the question whether such an analysis can help control the search process. We relate the size, generalization and modularity issues for programs evolved to control an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment, as exemplified by the Pac-Man game.","Title: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR COORDINATED REACTIVE CONTROL  
Abstract: The demands of rapid response and the complexity of many environments make it difficult to decompose, tune and coordinate reactive behaviors while ensuring consistency. Reinforcement learning networks can address the tuning problem, but do not address the problem of decomposition and coordination. We hypothesize that interacting reactions can often be decomposed into separate control tasks resident in separate networks and that the interaction can be coordinated through the tuning mechanism and a higher level controller. To explore these issues, we have implemented a reinforcement learning architecture as the reactive component of a two layer control system for a simulated race car. By varying the architecture, we test whether decomposing reactivity into separate controllers leads to superior overall performance and learning convergence in our domain. ",0
"Title: Problem Formulation, Program Synthesis and Program Transformation Techniques for Simulation, Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction (Research Statement)  
Abstract: A parallel version is proposed for a fundamental theorem of serial unconstrained optimization. The parallel theorem allows each of k parallel processors to use simultaneously a different algorithm, such as a descent, Newton, quasi-Newton or a conjugate gradient algorithm. Each processor can perform one or many steps of a serial algorithm on a portion of the gradient of the objective function assigned to it, independently of the other processors. Eventually a synchronization step is performed which, for differentiable convex functions, consists of taking a strong convex combination of the k points found by the k processors. For nonconvex, as well as convex, differentiable functions, the best point found by the k processors is taken, or any better point. The fundamental result that we establish is that any accumulation point of the parallel algorithm is stationary for the nonconvex case, and is a global solution for the convex case. Computational testing on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor indicate a speedup of the order of the number of processors employed.

Abstract: Random field models in image analysis and spatial statistics usually have local interactions. They can be simulated by Markov chains which update a single site at a time. The updating rules typically condition on only a few neighboring sites. If we want to approximate the expectation of a bounded function, can we make better use of the simulations than through the empirical estimator? We describe symmetrizations of the empirical estimator which are computationally feasible and can lead to considerable variance reduction. The method is reminiscent of the idea behind generalized von Mises statistics. To simplify the exposition, we consider mainly nearest neighbor random fields and the Gibbs sampler. ",0

Abstract: Research on nonmonotonic and default reasoning has identified several important criteria for preferring alternative default inferences. The theories of reasoning based on each of these criteria may uniformly be viewed as theories of rational inference, in which the reasoner selects maximally preferred states of belief. Though researchers have noted some cases of apparent conflict between the preferences supported by different theories, it has been hoped that these special theories of reasoning may be combined into a universal logic of nonmonotonic reasoning. We show that the different categories of preferences conflict more than has been realized, and adapt formal results from social choice theory to prove that every universal theory of default reasoning will violate at least one reasonable principle of rational reasoning. Our results can be interpreted as demonstrating that, within the preferential framework, we cannot expect much improvement on the rigid lexicographic priority mechanisms that have been proposed for conflict resolution.",0
"Title: Correcting Imperfect Domain Theories: A Knowledge-Level Analysis  
Abstract: Explanation-Based Learning [Mitchell et al., 1986; DeJong and Mooney, 1986] has shown promise as a powerful analytical learning technique. However, EBL is severely hampered by the requirement of a complete and correct domain theory for successful learning to occur. Clearly, in non-trivial domains, developing such a domain theory is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, much research has been devoted to understanding how an imperfect domain theory can be corrected and extended during system performance. In this paper, we present a characterization of this problem, and use it to analyze past research in the area. Past characterizations of the problem (e.g, [Mitchell et al., 1986; Rajamoney and DeJong, 1987]) have viewed the types of performance errors caused by a faulty domain theory as primary. In contrast, we focus primarily on the types of knowledge deficiencies present in the theory, and from these derive the types of performance errors that can result. Correcting the theory can be viewed as a search through the space of possible domain theories, with a variety of knowledge sources that can be used to guide the search. We examine the types of knowledge used by a variety of past systems for this purpose. The hope is that this analysis will indicate the need for a ""universal weak method"" of domain theory correction, in which different sources of knowledge for theory correction can be freely and flexibly combined. ","Title: Generalization of Clauses under Implication  
Abstract: In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation -subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under -subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under -subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under -subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under -subsumption of the expansion.",0
"Title: Testing the Robustness of the Genetic Algorithm on the Floating Building Block Representation.  
Abstract: Recent studies on a floating building block representation for the genetic algorithm (GA) suggest that there are many advantages to using the floating representation. This paper investigates the behavior of the GA on floating representation problems in response to three different types of pressures: (1) a reduction in the amount of genetic material available to the GA during the problem solving process, (2) functions which have negative-valued building blocks, and (3) randomizing non-coding segments. Results indicate that the GA's performance on floating representation problems is very robust. Significant reductions in genetic material (genome length) may be made with relatively small decrease in performance. The GA can effectively solve problems with negative building blocks. Randomizing non-coding segments appears to improve rather than harm GA performance. ","Title: On the Induction of Intelligible Ensembles  
Abstract: Ensembles of classifiers, e.g. decision trees, often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than single classifiers alone. Bagging and boosting are two standard ways of generating and combining multiple classifiers. Unfortunately, the increase in predictive performance is usually linked to a dramatic decrease in intelligibility: ensembles are more or less black boxes comparable to neural networks. So far attempts at pruning of ensembles have not been very successful, approximately reducing ensembles into half. This paper describes a different approach which both tries to keep ensemble-sizes small during induction already and also limits the complexity of single classifiers rigorously. Single classifiers are decision-stumps of a prespecified maximal depth. They are combined by majority voting. Ensembles are induced and pruned by a simple hill-climbing procedure. These ensembles can reasonably be transformed into equivalent decision trees. We conduct some empirical evaluation to investigate both predictive accuracies and classifier complexities.",0
"Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Derivation Replay in Partial-order vs State-space Planning  
Abstract: Case-based planning involves storing individual instances of problem-solving episodes and using them to tackle new planning problems. This paper is concerned with derivation replay, which is the main component of a form of case-based planning called derivational analogy (DA). Prior to this study, implementations of derivation replay have been based within state-space planning. We are motivated by the acknowledged superiority of partial-order (PO) planners in plan generation. Here we demonstrate that plan-space planning also has an advantage in replay. We will argue that the decoupling of planning (derivation) order and the execution order of plan steps, provided by partial-order planners, enables them to exploit the guidance of previous cases in a more efficient and straightforward fashion. We validate our hypothesis through a focused empirical comparison. ","Title: Cortical activity flips among quasi stationary states

","Title: Naive Bayesian classifier within ILP-R  
Abstract: When dealing with the classification problems, current ILP systems often lag behind state-of-the-art attributional learners. Part of the blame can be ascribed to a much larger hypothesis space which, therefore, cannot be as thoroughly explored. However, sometimes it is due to the fact that ILP systems do not take into account the probabilistic aspects of hypotheses when classifying unseen examples. This paper proposes just that. We developed a naive Bayesian classifier within our ILP-R first order learner. The learner itself uses a clever RELIEF based heuristic which is able to detect strong dependencies within the literal space when such dependencies exist. We conducted a series of experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. The results show that the combination of ILP-R together with the naive Bayesian classifier sometimes significantly improves the classification of unseen instances as measured by both classification accuracy and average information score.",0
"Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: In general, the machine learning process can be accelerated through the use of heuristic knowledge about the problem solution. For example, monomorphic typed Genetic Programming (GP) uses type information to reduce the search space and improve performance. Unfortunately, monomorphic typed GP also loses the generality of untyped GP: the generated programs are only suitable for inputs with the specified type. Polymorphic typed GP improves over mono-morphic and untyped GP by allowing the type information to be expressed in a more generic manner, and yet still imposes constraints on the search space. This paper describes a polymorphic GP system which can generate polymorphic programs: programs which take inputs of more than one type and produces outputs of more than one type. We also demonstrate its operation through the generation of the map polymorphic program.","Title: Annealed Competition of Experts for a Segmentation and Classification of Switching Dynamics  
Abstract: We present a method for the unsupervised segmentation of data streams originating from different unknown sources which alternate in time. We use an architecture consisting of competing neural networks. Memory is included in order to resolve ambiguities of input-output relations. In order to obtain maximal specialization, the competition is adiabatically increased during training. Our method achieves almost perfect identification and segmentation in the case of switching chaotic dynamics where input manifolds overlap and input-output relations are ambiguous. Only a small dataset is needed for the training proceedure. Applications to time series from complex systems demonstrate the potential relevance of our approach for time series analysis and short-term prediction. ",0
"Title: Some Training Subset Selection Methods for Supervised Learning in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: When using the Genetic Programming (GP) Algorithm on a difficult problem with a large set of training cases, a large population size is needed and a very large number of function-tree evaluations must be carried out. This paper describes how to reduce the number of such evaluations by selecting a small subset of the training data set on which to actually carry out the GP algorithm. Three subset selection methods described in the paper are: Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS), using the current GP run to select `difficult' and/or disused cases, Historical Subset Selection (HSS), using previous GP runs, Random Subset Selection (RSS). GP, GP+DSS, GP+HSS, GP+RSS are compared on a large classification problem. GP+DSS can produce better results in less than 20% of the time taken by GP. GP+HSS can nearly match the results of GP, and, perhaps surprisingly, GP+RSS can occasionally approach the results of GP. GP and GP+DSS are then compared on a smaller problem, and a hybrid Dynamic Fitness Function (DFF), based on DSS, is proposed.","Title: On the Complexity of Solving Markov Decision Problems  
Abstract: Markov decision problems (MDPs) provide the foundations for a number of problems of interest to AI researchers studying automated planning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we summarize results regarding the complexity of solving MDPs and the running time of MDP solution algorithms. We argue that, although MDPs can be solved efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical algorithms for solving large problems quickly. To encourage future research, we sketch some alternative methods of analysis that rely on the struc ture of MDPs.",0

"Title: Bayesian Models for Non-Linear Autoregressions  
Abstract: This paper argues that Bayesian probability theory is a general method for machine learning. From two well-founded axioms, the theory is capable of accomplishing learning tasks that are incremental or non-incremental, supervised or unsupervised. It can learn from different types of data, regardless of whether they are noisy or perfect, independent facts or behaviors of an unknown machine. These capabilities are (partially) demonstrated in the paper through the uniform application of the theory to two typical types of machine learning: incremental concept learning and unsupervised data classification. The generality of the theory suggests that the process of learning may not have so many different ""types"" as currently held, and the method that is the oldest may be the best after all. ","Title: STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF COMBAT WITH HUMAN FACTORS  
Abstract: This highly interdisciplinary project extends previous work in combat modeling and in control-theoretic descriptions of decision-making human factors in complex activities. A previous paper has established the first theory of the statistical mechanics of combat (SMC), developed using modern methods of statistical mechanics, baselined to empirical data gleaned from the National Training Center (NTC). This previous project has also established a JANUS(T)-NTC computer simulation/wargame of NTC, providing a statistical ``what-if '' capability for NTC scenarios. This mathematical formulation is ripe for control-theoretic extension to include human factors, a methodology previously developed in the context of teleoperated vehicles. Similar NTC scenarios differing at crucial decision points will be used for data to model the inuence of decision making on combat. The results may then be used to improve present human factors and C 2 algorithms in computer simulations/wargames. Our approach is to ``subordinate'' the SMC nonlinear stochastic equations, fitted to NTC scenarios, to establish the zeroth order description of that combat. In practice, an equivalent mathematical-physics representation is used, more suitable for numerical and formal work, i.e., a Lagrangian representation. Theoretically, these equations are nested within a larger set of nonlinear stochastic operator-equations which include C 3 human factors, e.g., supervisory decisions. In this study, we propose to perturb this operator theory about the SMC zeroth order set of equations. Then, subsets of scenarios fit to zeroth order, originally considered to be similarly degenerate, can be further split perturbatively to distinguish C 3 decision-making inuences. New methods of Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (VFSR), developed in the previous project, will be used for fitting these models to empirical data. ",0
"Title: Some Comments on the Information Stored in Sparse Distributed Memory  
Abstract: Report R95:11 ISRN : SICS-R--95/11-SE ISSN : 0283-3638 Abstract We consider a sparse distributed memory with randomly chosen hard locations, in which an unknown number T of random data vectors have been stored. A method is given to estimate T from the content of the memory with high accuracy. In fact, our estimate is unbiased, the coefficient of variation being roughly inversely proportional to p MU , where M is the number of hard locations in the memory and U the length of data, so the accuracy can be made arbitrarily high by making the memory big enough. A consequence of this is that the good reading methods in [5] and [6] can be used without any need for the special extra location introduced there.

Abstract: resent allowed sequences of resolution steps for the initial theory. There are, however, many characterizations of allowed sequences of resolution steps that cannot be expressed by a set of resolvents. One approach to this problem is presented, the system mer-lin, which is based on an earlier technique for learning finite-state automata that represent allowed sequences of resolution steps. merlin extends the previous technique in three ways: i) negative examples are considered in addition to positive examples, ii) a new strategy for performing generalization is used, and iii) a technique for converting the learned automaton to a logic program is included. Results from experiments are presented in which merlin outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing generalization, and a traditional covering technique. The latter result can be explained by the limited expressiveness of hypotheses produced by covering and also by the fact that covering needs to produce the correct base clauses for a recursive definition before ",0

Abstract: We present an algorithm for arc reversal in Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables, and consider some of its advantages, especially for the simulation of dynamic probabilistic networks. In particular, the method allows one to produce CPTs for nodes involved in the reversal that exploit regularities in the conditional distributions. We argue that this approach alleviates some of the overhead associated with arc reversal, plays an important role in evidence integration and can be used to restrict sampling of variables in DPNs. We also provide an algorithm that detects the dynamic irrelevance of state variables in forward simulation. This algorithm exploits the structured CPTs in a reversed network to determine, in a time-independent fashion, the conditions under which a variable does or does not need to be sampled.",0
"Title: How to Dynamically Merge Markov Decision Processes  
Abstract: We are frequently called upon to perform multiple tasks that compete for our attention and resource. Often we know the optimal solution to each task in isolation; in this paper, we describe how this knowledge can be exploited to efficiently find good solutions for doing the tasks in parallel. We formulate this problem as that of dynamically merging multiple Markov decision processes (MDPs) into a composite MDP, and present a new theoretically-sound dynamic programming algorithm for finding an optimal policy for the composite MDP. We analyze various aspects of our algorithm and Every day, we are faced with the problem of doing multiple tasks in parallel, each of which competes for our attention and resource. If we are running a job shop, we must decide which machines to allocate to which jobs, and in what order, so that no jobs miss their deadlines. If we are a mail delivery robot, we must find the intended recipients of the mail while simultaneously avoiding fixed obstacles (such as walls) and mobile obstacles (such as people), and still manage to keep ourselves sufficiently charged up. Frequently we know how to perform each task in isolation; this paper considers how we can take the information we have about the individual tasks and combine it to efficiently find an optimal solution for doing the entire set of tasks in parallel. More importantly, we describe a theoretically-sound algorithm for doing this merging dynamically; new tasks (such as a new job arrival at a job shop) can be assimilated online into the solution being found for the ongoing set of simultaneous tasks. illustrate its use on a simple merging problem.","Title: ID2-of-3: Constructive Induction of M of-N Concepts for Discriminators in Decision Trees

Second, we show how these concepts can be formed as internal nodes of decision trees, serving as a bias to the learner. Finally, we evaluate the method on several artificially generated and naturally occurring data sets to determine the effects of this bias.",0

Abstract: Practical optimization problems such as job-shop scheduling often involve optimization criteria that change over time. Repair-based frameworks have been identified as flexible computational paradigms for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. Since the control problem of repair-based optimization is severe, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques can be potentially helpful. However, some of the fundamental assumptions made by traditional RL algorithms are not valid for repair-based optimization. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) compensates for some of the limitations of traditional RL approaches. In this paper, we present a Case-Based Reasoning RL approach, implemented in the C A B I N S system, for repair-based optimization. We chose job-shop scheduling as the testbed for our approach. Our experimental results show that C A B I N S is able to effectively solve problems with changing optimization criteria which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base.

"Title: Learning from undiscounted delayed rewards  
Abstract: The general framework of reinforcement learning has been proposed by several researchers for both the solution of optimization problems and the realization of adaptive control schemes. To allow for an efficient application of reinforcement learning in either of these areas, it is necessary to solve both the structural and the temporal credit assignment problem. In this paper, we concentrate on the latter which is usually tackled through the use of learning algorithms that employ discounted rewards. We argue that for realistic problems this kind of solution is not satisfactory, since it does not address the effect of noise originating from different experiences and does not allow for an easy explanation of the parameters involved in the learning process. As a possible solution, we propose to keep the delayed reward undiscounted, but to discount the actual adaptation rate. Empirical results show that dependent on the kind of discount used amore stable convergence and even an increase in performance can be obtained.

Abstract: Consider estimating the mean vector from data N n (; 2 I) with l q norm loss, q 1, when is known to lie in an n-dimensional l p ball, p 2 (0; 1). For large n, the ratio of minimax linear risk to minimax risk can be arbitrarily large if p &lt; q. Obvious exceptions aside, the limiting ratio equals 1 only if p = q = 2. Our arguments are mostly indirect, involving a reduction to a univariate Bayes minimax problem. When p &lt; q, simple non-linear co-ordinatewise threshold rules are asymptotically minimax at small signal-to-noise ratios, and within a bounded factor of asymptotic minimaxity in general. Our results are basic to a theory of estimation in Besov spaces ",0

An adaptive quantisation scheme is introduced, through which the discrete division of input space is built up from scratch by the system itself. ",0
"Title: A Generalization of Sauer's Lemma  
Abstract: The discrimination powers of Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ) networks are compared for overlapping Gaussian distributions. It is shown, both analytically and with Monte Carlo studies, that the MLP network handles high dimensional problems in a more efficient way than LVQ. This is mainly due to the sigmoidal form of the MLP transfer function, but also to the the fact that the MLP uses hyper-planes more efficiently. Both algorithms are equally robust to limited training sets and the learning curves fall off like 1=M, where M is the training set size, which is compared to theoretical predictions from statistical estimates and Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds. ","Title: Simplifying Decision Trees: A Survey  
Abstract: Induced decision trees are an extensively-researched solution to classification tasks. For many practical tasks, the trees produced by tree-generation algorithms are not comprehensible to users due to their size and complexity. Although many tree induction algorithms have been shown to produce simpler, more comprehensible trees (or data structures derived from trees) with good classification accuracy, tree simplification has usually been of secondary concern relative to accuracy and no attempt has been made to survey the literature from the perspective of simplification. We present a framework that organizes the approaches to tree simplification and summarize and critique the approaches within this framework. The purpose of this survey is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise overview of tree-simplification approaches and insight into their relative capabilities. In our final discussion, we briefly describe some empirical findings and discuss the application of tree induction algorithms to case retrieval in case-based reasoning systems.",0
"Title: Conceptual Analogy  
Abstract: Conceptual analogy (CA) is an approach that integrates conceptualization, i.e., memory organization based on prior experiences and analogical reasoning (Borner 1994a). It was implemented prototypically and tested to support the design process in building engineering (Borner and Janetzko 1995, Borner 1995). There are a number of features that distinguish CA from standard approaches to CBR and AR. First of all, CA automatically extracts the knowledge needed to support design tasks (i.e., complex case representations, the relevance of object features and relations, and proper adaptations) from attribute-value representations of prior layouts. Secondly, it effectively determines the similarity of complex case representations in terms of adaptability. Thirdly, implemented and integrated into a highly interactive and adaptive system architecture it allows for incremental knowledge acquisition and user support. This paper surveys the basic assumptions and the psychological results which influenced the development of CA. It sketches the knowledge representation formalisms employed and characterizes the sub-processes needed to integrate memory organization and analogical reasoning. ","Title: Learning Analytically and Inductively  
Abstract: Learning is a fundamental component of intelligence, and a key consideration in designing cognitive architectures such as Soar [ Laird et al., 1986 ] . This chapter considers the question of what constitutes an appropriate general-purpose learning mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that might explain and reproduce the rich variety of learning capabilities of humans, ranging from learning perceptual-motor skills such as how to ride a bicycle, to learning highly cognitive tasks such as how to play chess. Research on learning in fields such as cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, and statistics has led to the identification of two distinct classes of learning methods: inductive and analytic. Inductive methods, such as neural network Backpropagation, learn general laws by finding statistical correlations and regularities among a large set of training examples. In contrast, analytical methods, such as Explanation-Based Learning, acquire general laws from many fewer training examples. They rely instead on prior knowledge to analyze individual training examples in detail, then use this analysis to distinguish relevant example features from the irrelevant. The question considered in this chapter is how to best combine inductive and analytical learning in an architecture that seeks to cover the range of learning exhibited by intelligent systems such as humans. We present a specific learning mechanism, Explanation Based Neural Network learning (EBNN), that blends these two types of learning, and present experimental results demonstrating its ability to learn control strategies for a mobile robot using ",0
"Title: Systematic Evaluation of Design Decisions in CBR Systems  
Abstract: Two important goals in the evaluation of an AI theory or model are to assess the merit of the design decisions in the performance of an implemented computer system and to analyze the impact in the performance when the system faces problem domains with different characteristics. This is particularly difficult in case-based reasoning systems because such systems are typically very complex, as are the tasks and domains in which they operate. We present a methodology for the evaluation of case-based reasoning systems through systematic empirical experimentation over a range of system configurations and environmental conditions, coupled with rigorous statistical analysis of the results of the experiments. This methodology enables us to understand the behavior of the system in terms of the theory and design of the computational model, to select the best system configuration for a given domain, and to predict how the system will behave in response to changing domain and problem characteristics. A case study of a mul-tistrategy case-based and reinforcement learning system which performs autonomous robotic navigation is presented as an example.

Abstract: We examine a new approach to modeling uncertainty based on plausibility measures, where a plausibility measure just associates with an event its plausibility, an element is some partially ordered set. This approach is easily seen to generalize other approaches to modeling uncertainty, such as probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures. The lack of structure in a plausibility measure makes it easy for us to add structure on an as needed basis, letting us examine what is required to ensure that a plausibility measure has certain properties of interest. This gives us insight into the essential features of the properties in question, while allowing us to prove general results that apply to many approaches to reasoning about uncertainty. Plausibility measures have already proved useful in analyzing default reasoning. In this paper, we examine their algebraic properties, analogues to the use of + and fi in probability theory. An understanding of such properties will be essential if plausibility measures are to be used in practice as a representation tool.",0

Abstract: In most applications of neuro-evolution, each individual in the population represents a complete neural network. Recent work on the SANE system, however, has demonstrated that evolving individual neurons often produces a more efficient genetic search. This paper demonstrates that while SANE can solve easy tasks very quickly, it often stalls in larger problems. A hierarchical approach to neuro-evolution is presented that overcomes SANE's difficulties by integrating both a neuron-level exploratory search and a network-level exploitive search. In a robot arm manipulation task, the hierarchical approach outperforms both a neuron-based search and a network-based search.

"Title: The Use of Neural Networks to Support ""Intelligent"" Scientific Computing  
Abstract: In this paper we report on the use of backpropagation based neural networks to implement a phase of the computational intelligence process of the PYTHIA[3] expert system for supporting the numerical simulation of applications modelled by partial differential equations (PDEs). PYTHIA is an exemplar based reasoning system that provides advice on what method and parameters to use for the simulation of a specified PDE based application. When advice is requested, the characteristics of the given model are matched with the characteristics of previously seen classes of models. The performance of various solution methods on previously seen similar classes of models is then used as a basis for predicting what method to use. Thus, a major step of the reasoning process in PYTHIA involves the analysis and categorization of models into classes of models based on their characteristics. In this study we demonstrate the use of neural networks to identify the class of predefined models whose characteristics match the ones of the specified PDE based application.

Abstract: This work presents an application of a machine learning for characterizing an important property of natural DNA sequences compositional inhomogeneity. Compositional segments often correspond to meaningful biological units. Taking into account such inhomogeneity is a prerequisite of successful recognition of functional features in DNA sequences, especially, protein-coding genes. Here we present a technique for DNA segmentation using hidden Markov models. A DNA sequence is represented by a chain of homogeneous segments, each described by one of a few statistically discriminated hidden states, whose contents form a first-order Markov chain. The technique is used to describe and compare chromosomes I and IV of the completely sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) genome. Our results indicate the existence of a few well separated states, which gives support to the isochore theory. We also explore the model's likelihood landscape and analyze the dynamics of the optimization process, thus addressing the problem of reliability of the obtained optima and efficiency of the algorithms.

"Title: In Search Of Articulated Attractors  
Abstract: Recurrent attractor networks offer many advantages over feed-forward networks for the modeling of psychological phenomena. Their dynamic nature allows them to capture the time course of cognitive processing, and their learned weights may often be easily interpreted as soft constraints between representational components. Perhaps the most significant feature of such networks, however, is their ability to facilitate generalization by enforcing well formedness constraints on intermediate and output representations. Attractor networks which learn the systematic regularities of well formed representations by exposure to a small number of examples are said to possess articulated attractors. This paper investigates the conditions under which articulated attractors arise in recurrent networks trained using variants of backpropagation. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that such structured attrac-tors can spontaneously appear in an emergence of systematic-ity, if an appropriate error signal is presented directly to the recurrent processing elements. We show, however, that distal error signals, backpropagated through intervening weights, pose serious problems for networks of this kind. We present simulation results, discuss the reasons for this difficulty, and suggest some directions for future attempts to surmount it.

Abstract: Parameterized heuristics offers an elegant and powerful theoretical framework for design and analysis of autonomous adaptive communication networks. Routing of messages in such networks presents a real-time instance of a multi-criterion optimization problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper describes a framework for heuristic routing in large networks. The effectiveness of the heuristic routing mechanism upon which Quo Vadis is based is described as part of a simulation study within a network with grid topology. A formal analysis of the underlying principles is presented through the incremental design of a set of heuristic decision functions that can be used to guide messages along a near-optimal (e.g., minimum delay) path in a large network. This paper carefully derives the properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics and identify the conditions under which they are guaranteed to route messages along an optimal path. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the theoretical results presented in the paper to the design of intelligent autonomous adaptive communication networks and an outline of some directions of future research.",0
"Title: Minimax Bayes, asymptotic minimax and sparse wavelet priors  
Abstract: Pinsker(1980) gave a precise asymptotic evaluation of the minimax mean squared error of estimation of a signal in Gaussian noise when the signal is known a priori to lie in a compact ellipsoid in Hilbert space. This `Minimax Bayes' method can be applied to a variety of global non-parametric estimation settings with parameter spaces far from ellipsoidal. For example it leads to a theory of exact asymptotic minimax estimation over norm balls in Besov and Triebel spaces using simple co-ordinatewise estimators and wavelet bases. This paper outlines some features of the method common to several applications. In particular, we derive new results on the exact asymptotic minimax risk over weak ` p balls in R n as n ! 1, and also for a class of `local' estimators on the Triebel scale. By its very nature, the method reveals the structure of asymptotically least favorable distributions. Thus we may simulate `least favorable' sample paths. We illustrate this for estimation of a signal in Gaussian white noise over norm balls in certain Besov spaces. In wavelet bases, when p &lt; 2, the least favorable priors are sparse, and the resulting sample paths strikingly different from those observed in Pinsker's ellipsoidal setting (p = 2).

","Title: Incremental methods for computing bounds in partially observable Markov decision processes  
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) allow one to model complex dynamic decision or control problems that include both action outcome uncertainty and imperfect observabil-ity. The control problem is formulated as a dynamic optimization problem with a value function combining costs or rewards from multiple steps. In this paper we propose, analyse and test various incremental methods for computing bounds on the value function for control problems with infinite discounted horizon criteria. The methods described and tested include novel incremental versions of grid-based linear interpolation method and simple lower bound method with Sondik's updates. Both of these can work with arbitrary points of the belief space and can be enhanced by various heuristic point selection strategies. Also introduced is a new method for computing an initial upper bound the fast informed bound method. This method is able to improve significantly on the standard and commonly used upper bound computed by the MDP-based method. The quality of resulting bounds are tested on a maze navigation problem with 20 states, 6 actions and 8 observations. ",0

Abstract: In this paper we study a forecasting model based on mixture of experts for predicting the French electric daily consumption energy. We split the task into two parts. Using mixture of experts, a first model predicts the electricity demand from the exogenous variables (such as temperature and degree of cloud cover) and can be viewed as a nonlinear regression model of mixture of Gaussians. Using a single neural network, a second model predicts the evolution of the residual error of the first one, and can be viewed as an nonlinear autoregression model. We analyze the splitting of the input space generated by the mixture of experts model, and compare the performance to models presently used.

Abstract: Prioritized sweeping is a model-based reinforcement learning method that attempts to focus an agent's limited computational resources to achieve a good estimate of the value of environment states. To choose effectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweeping uses a simple heuristic to focus computation on the states that are likely to have the largest errors. In this paper, we introduce generalized prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates in a representation-specific manner. This allows us to extend prioritized sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with compact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces. We apply this method for generalized model approximators (such as Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare our approach with classical prioritized sweeping. ",0

","Title: AUTOMATED TOPOLOGY AND SIZING OF ANALOG CIRCUITS AUTOMATED DESIGN OF BOTH THE TOPOLOGY AND SIZING
Abstract: This paper describes an automated process for designing analog electrical circuits based on the principles of natural selection, sexual recombination, and developmental biology. The design process starts with the random creation of a large population of program trees composed of circuit-constructing functions. Each program tree specifies the steps by which a fully developed circuit is to be progressively developed from a common embryonic circuit appropriate for the type of circuit that the user wishes to design. Each fully developed circuit is translated into a netlist, simulated using a modified version of SPICE, and evaluated as to how well it satisfies the user's design requirements. The fitness measure is a user-written computer program that may incorporate any calculable characteristic or combination of characteristics of the circuit, including the circuit's behavior in the time domain, its behavior in the frequency domain, its power consumption, the number of components, cost of components, or surface area occupied by its components. The population of program trees is genetically bred over a series of many generations using genetic programming. Genetic programming is driven by a fitness measure and employs genetic operations such as Darwinian reproduction, sexual recombination (crossover), and occasional mutation to create offspring. This automated evolutionary process produces both the topology of the circuit and the numerical values for each component.

Abstract: Machine learning and knowledge engineering have always been strongly related, but the introduction of new representations in knowledge engineering has created a gap between them. This paper describes research aimed at applying machine learning techniques to the current knowledge engineering representations. We propose a system that redesigns a part of a knowledge based system, the so called control knowledge. We claim a strong similarity between redesign of knowledge based systems and incremental machine learning. Finally we will relate this work to existing research. ","Title: Rationality and Intelligence  
Abstract: The long-term goal of our field is the creation and understanding of intelligence. Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. The concept of rational agency has long been considered a leading candidate to fulfill this role. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in the formal conception of rationality that brings it closer to our informal conception of intelligence and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice. Some directions for future research are indicated.",0
"Title: Submitted to Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing Neural Network Constructive Algorithms: Trading Generalization for Learning Efficiency?  
Abstract: There are currently several types of constructive, or growth, algorithms available for training a feed-forward neural network. This paper describes and explains the main ones, using a fundamental approach to the multi-layer perceptron problem-solving mechanisms. The claimed convergence properties of the algorithms are verified using just two mapping theorems, which consequently enables all the algorithms to be unified under a basic mechanism. The algorithms are compared and contrasted and the deficiencies of some highlighted. The fundamental reasons for the actual success of these algorithms are extracted, and used to suggest where they might most fruitfully be applied. A suspicion that they are not a panacea for all current neural network difficulties, and that one must somewhere along the line pay for the learning efficiency they promise, is developed into an argument that their generalization abilities will lie on average below that of back-propagation. ","Title: Correcting Imperfect Domain Theories: A Knowledge-Level Analysis  
Abstract: Explanation-Based Learning [Mitchell et al., 1986; DeJong and Mooney, 1986] has shown promise as a powerful analytical learning technique. However, EBL is severely hampered by the requirement of a complete and correct domain theory for successful learning to occur. Clearly, in non-trivial domains, developing such a domain theory is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, much research has been devoted to understanding how an imperfect domain theory can be corrected and extended during system performance. In this paper, we present a characterization of this problem, and use it to analyze past research in the area. Past characterizations of the problem (e.g, [Mitchell et al., 1986; Rajamoney and DeJong, 1987]) have viewed the types of performance errors caused by a faulty domain theory as primary. In contrast, we focus primarily on the types of knowledge deficiencies present in the theory, and from these derive the types of performance errors that can result. Correcting the theory can be viewed as a search through the space of possible domain theories, with a variety of knowledge sources that can be used to guide the search. We examine the types of knowledge used by a variety of past systems for this purpose. The hope is that this analysis will indicate the need for a ""universal weak method"" of domain theory correction, in which different sources of knowledge for theory correction can be freely and flexibly combined.

Abstract: In this paper we suggest determinations as a representation of knowledge that should be easy to understand. We briefly review determinations, which can be displayed in a tabular format, and their use in prediction, which involves a simple matching process. We describe ConDet, an algorithm that uses feature selection to construct determinations from training data, augmented by a condensation process that collapses rows to produce simpler structures. We report experiments that show condensation reduces complexity with no loss of accuracy, then discuss ConDet's relation to other work and outline directions for future studies. ",0
"Title: Explaining ""Explaining Away""  
Abstract: Explaining away is a common pattern of reasoning in which the confirmation of one cause of an observed or believed event reduces the need to invoke alternative causes. The opposite of explaining away also can occur, in which the confirmation of one cause increases belief in another. We provide a general qualitative probabilistic analysis of intercausal reasoning, and identify the property of the interaction among the causes, product synergy, that determines which form of reasoning is appropriate. Product synergy extends the qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) formalism to support qualitative intercausal inference about the directions of change in probabilistic belief. The intercausal relation also justifies Occam's razor, facilitating pruning in search for likely diagnoses. 0 Portions of this paper originally appeared in Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning [16]. y Supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-8807061 to Carnegie Mellon and by the Rockwell International Science Center. ","Title: Simultaneous Learning of Control Laws and Local Environment Representations for Intelligent Navigation Robots  
Abstract: Two issues of an intelligent navigation robot have been addressed in this work. First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.",0
"Title: Chapter 4 Empirical comparison of stochastic algorithms Empirical comparison of stochastic algorithms in a graph
Abstract: There are several stochastic methods that can be used for solving NP-hard optimization problems approximatively. Examples of such algorithms include (in order of increasing computational complexity) stochastic greedy search methods, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. We investigate which of these methods is likely to give best performance in practice, with respect to the computational effort each requires. We study this problem empirically by selecting a set of stochastic algorithms with varying computational complexity, and by experimentally evaluating for each method how the goodness of the results achieved improves with increasing computational time. For the evaluation, we use a graph optimization problem, which is closely related to several real-world practical problems. To get a wider perspective of the goodness of the achieved results, the stochastic methods are also compared against special-case greedy heuristics. This investigation suggests that although genetic algorithms can provide good results, simpler stochastic algorithms can achieve similar performance more quickly. ","Title: Implicit learning in 3D object recognition: The importance of temporal context  
Abstract: A novel architecture and set of learning rules for cortical self-organization is proposed. The model is based on the idea that multiple information channels can modulate one another's plasticity. Features learned from bottom-up information sources can thus be influenced by those learned from contextual pathways, and vice versa. A maximum likelihood cost function allows this scheme to be implemented in a biologically feasible, hierarchical neural circuit. In simulations of the model, we first demonstrate the utility of temporal context in modulating plasticity. The model learns a representation that categorizes people's faces according to identity, independent of viewpoint, by taking advantage of the temporal continuity in image sequences. In a second set of simulations, we add plasticity to the contextual stream and explore variations in the architecture. In this case, the model learns a two-tiered representation, starting with a coarse view-based clustering and proceeding to a finer clustering of more specific stimulus features. This model provides a tenable account of how people may perform 3D object recognition in a hierarchical, bottom-up fashion. ",0
"Title: Covering vs. Divide-and-Conquer for Top-Down Induction of Logic Programs  
Abstract: covering has been formalized and used extensively. In this work, the divide-and-conquer technique is formalized as well and compared to the covering technique in a logic programming framework. Covering works by repeatedly specializing an overly general hypothesis, on each iteration focusing on finding a clause with a high coverage of positive examples. Divide-and-conquer works by specializing an overly general hypothesis once, focusing on discriminating positive from negative examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that there are cases when more accurate hypotheses can be found by divide-and-conquer than by covering. Moreover, since covering considers the same alternatives repeatedly it tends to be less efficient than divide-and-conquer, which never considers the same alternative twice. On the other hand, covering searches a larger hypothesis space, which may result in that more compact hypotheses are found by this technique than by divide-and-conquer. Furthermore, divide-and-conquer is, in contrast to covering, not applicable to learn ing recursive definitions.","Title: Learning from Bad Data  
Abstract: The data describing resolutions to telephone network local loop ""troubles,"" from which we wish to learn rules for dispatching technicians, are notoriously unreliable. Anecdotes abound detailing reasons why a resolution entered by a technician would not be valid, ranging from sympathy to fear to ignorance to negligence to management pressure. In this paper, we describe four different approaches to dealing with the problem of ""bad"" data in order first to determine whether machine learning has promise in this domain, and then to determine how well machine learning might perform. We then offer evidence that machine learning can help to build a dispatching method that will perform better than the system currently in place.",0
"Title: Neural net architectures for temporal sequence processing  
Abstract: I present a general taxonomy of neural net architectures for processing time-varying patterns. This taxonomy subsumes many existing architectures in the literature, and points to several promising architectures that have yet to be examined. Any architecture that processes time-varying patterns requires two conceptually distinct components: a short-term memory that holds on to relevant past events and an associator that uses the short-term memory to classify or predict. My taxonomy is based on a characterization of short-term memory models along the dimensions of form, content, and adaptability. Experiments on predicting future values of a financial time series (US dollar-Swiss franc exchange rates) are presented using several alternative memory models. The results of these experiments serve as a baseline against which more sophisticated architectures can be compared. Neural networks have proven to be a promising alternative to traditional techniques for nonlinear temporal prediction tasks (e.g., Curtiss, Brandemuehl, & Kreider, 1992; Lapedes & Farber, 1987; Weigend, Huberman, & Rumelhart, 1992). However, temporal prediction is a particularly challenging problem because conventional neural net architectures and algorithms are not well suited for patterns that vary over time. The prototypical use of neural nets is in structural pattern recognition. In such a task, a collection of features|visual, semantic, or otherwise|is presented to a network and the network must categorize the input feature pattern as belonging to one or more classes. For example, a network might be trained to classify animal species based on a set of attributes describing living creatures such as ""has tail"", ""lives in water"", or ""is carnivorous""; or a network could be trained to recognize visual patterns over a two-dimensional pixel array as a letter in fA; B; . . . ; Zg. In such tasks, the network is presented with all relevant information simultaneously. In contrast, temporal pattern recognition involves processing of patterns that evolve over time. The appropriate response at a particular point in time depends not only on the current input, but potentially all previous inputs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the basic framework for a temporal prediction problem. I assume that time is quantized into discrete steps, a sensible assumption because many time series of interest are intrinsically discrete, and continuous series can be sampled at a fixed interval. The input at time t is denoted x(t). For univariate series, this input ","Title: Topography And Ocular Dominance: A Model Exploring Positive Correlations  
Abstract: The map from eye to brain in vertebrates is topographic, i.e. neighbouring points in the eye map to neighbouring points in the brain. In addition, when two eyes innervate the same target structure, the two sets of fibres segregate to form ocular dominance stripes. Experimental evidence from the frog and goldfish suggests that these two phenomena may be subserved by the same mechanisms. We present a computational model that addresses the formation of both topography and ocular dominance. The model is based on a form of competitive learning with subtractive enforcement of a weight normalization rule. Inputs to the model are distributed patterns of activity presented simultaneously in both eyes. An important aspect of this model is that ocular dominance segregation can occur when the two eyes are positively correlated, whereas previous models have tended to assume zero or negative correlations between the eyes. This allows investigation of the dependence of the pattern of stripes on the degree of correlation between the eyes: we find that increasing correlation leads to narrower stripes. Experiments are suggested to test this prediction.",0
"Title: Genetic Algorithms for Automated Tuning of Fuzzy Controllers: A Transportation Application  
Abstract: We describe the design and tuning of a controller for enforcing compliance with a prescribed velocity profile for a rail-based transportation system. This requires following a trajectory, rather than fixed set-points (as in automobiles). We synthesize a fuzzy controller for tracking the velocity profile, while providing a smooth ride and staying within the prescribed speed limits. We use a genetic algorithm to tune the fuzzy controller's performance by adjusting its parameters (the scaling factors and the membership functions) in a sequential order of significance. We show that this approach results in a controller that is superior to the manually designed one, and with only modest computational effort. This makes it possible to customize automated tuning to a variety of different configurations of the route, the terrain, the power configuration, and the cargo. ","Title: Fast Numerical Integration of Relaxation Oscillator Networks Based on Singular Limit Solutions  
Abstract: Relaxation oscillations exhibiting more than one time scale arise naturally from many physical systems. This paper proposes a method to numerically integrate large systems of relaxation oscillators. The numerical technique, called the singular limit method, is derived from analysis of relaxation oscillations in the singular limit. In such limit, system evolution gives rise to time instants at which fast dynamics takes place and intervals between them during which slow dynamics takes place. A full description of the method is given for LEGION (locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator networks), where fast dynamics, characterized by jumping which leads to dramatic phase shifts, is captured in this method by iterative operation and slow dynamics is entirely solved. The singular limit method is evaluated by computer experiments, and it produces remarkable speedup compared to other methods of integrating these systems. The speedup makes it possible to simulate large-scale oscillator networks. ",0
"Title: Analysis of the Numerical Effects of Parallelism on a Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of relaxed synchronization on both the numerical and parallel efficiency of parallel genetic algorithms (GAs). We describe a coarse-grain geographically structured parallel genetic algorithm. Our experiments provide preliminary evidence that asynchronous versions of these algorithms have a lower run time than synchronous GAs. Our analysis shows that this improvement is due to (1) decreased synchronization costs and (2) high numerical efficiency (e.g. fewer function evaluations) for the asynchronous GAs. This analysis includes a critique of the utility of traditional parallel performance measures for parallel GAs. ","Title: Employing Linear Regression in Regression Tree Leaves

"Title: An Incremental Interactive Algorithm for Regular Grammar Inference  
Abstract: We present provably correct interactive algorithms for learning regular grammars from positive examples and membership queries. A structurally complete set of strings from a language L(G) corresponding to a target regular grammar G implicitly specifies a lattice of finite state automata (FSA) which contains a FSA M G corresponding to G. The lattice is compactly represented as a version-space and M G is identified by searching the version-space using membership queries. We explore the problem of regular grammar inference in a setting where positive examples are provided intermittently. We provide an incremental version of the algorithm along with a set of sufficient conditions for its convergence.","Title: APPROXIMATION IN L p (R d FROM SPACES SPANNED BY THE PERTURBED INTEGER TRANSLATES OF

In case the points of translation, ffi, are scattered throughout R d , the approximation problem is only well understood in the ""stationary"" setting. In this work, we treat the ""non-stationary"" setting under the assumption that ffi is a small perturbation of Z d .

"Title: ASOCS: A Multilayered Connectionist Network with Guaranteed Learning of Arbitrary Mappings  
Abstract: This paper reviews features of a new class of multilayer connectionist architectures known as ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems). ASOCS is similar to most decision-making neural network models in that it attempts to learn an adaptive set of arbitrary vector mappings. However, it differs dramatically in its mechanisms. ASOCS is based on networks of adaptive digital elements which self-modify using local information. Function specification is entered incrementally by use of rules, rather than complete input-output vectors, such that a processing network is able to extract critical features from a large environment and give output in a parallel fashion. Learning also uses parallelism and self-organization such that a new rule is completely learned in time linear with the depth of the network. The model guarantees learning of any arbitrary mapping of boolean input-output vectors. The model is also stable in that learning does not erase any previously learned mappings except those explicitly contradicted. ","Title: Generating Declarative Language Bias for Top-Down ILP Algorithms  
Abstract: Many of today's algorithms for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) put a heavy burden and responsibility on the user, because their declarative bias have to be defined in a rather low-level fashion. To address this issue, we developed a method for generating declarative language bias for top-down ILP systems from high-level declarations. The key feature of our approach is the distinction between a user level and an expert level of language bias declarations. The expert provides abstract meta-declarations, and the user declares the relationship between the meta-level and the given database to obtain a low-level declarative language bias. The suggested languages allow for compact and abstract specifications of the declarative language bias for top-down ILP systems using schemata. We verified several properties of the translation algorithm that generates schemata, and applied it successfully to a few chemical domains. As a consequence, we propose to use a two-level approach to generate declarative language bias.",0
"Title: Active Gesture Recognition using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes  
Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 367 Appeared 13th IEEE Intl. Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR '96), Vienna, Austria. Abstract We present a foveated gesture recognition system that guides an active camera to foveate salient features based on a reinforcement learning paradigm. Using vision routines previously implemented for an interactive environment, we determine the spatial location of salient body parts of a user and guide an active camera to obtain images of gestures or expressions. A hidden-state reinforcement learning paradigm based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is used to implement this visual attention. The attention module selects targets to foveate based on the goal of successful recognition, and uses a new multiple-model Q-learning formulation. Given a set of target and distractor gestures, our system can learn where to foveate to maximally discriminate a particular gesture.","Title: A Comparison of Induction Algorithms for Selective and non-Selective Bayesian Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel induction algorithm for Bayesian networks. This selective Bayesian network classifier selects a subset of attributes that maximizes predictive accuracy prior to the network learning phase, thereby learning Bayesian networks with a bias for small, high-predictive-accuracy networks. We compare the performance of this classifier with selective and non-selective naive Bayesian classifiers. We show that the selective Bayesian network classifier performs significantly better than both versions of the naive Bayesian classifier on almost all databases analyzed, and hence is an enhancement of the naive Bayesian classifier. Relative to the non-selective Bayesian network classifier, our selective Bayesian network classifier generates networks that are computationally simpler to evaluate and that display predictive accuracy comparable to that of Bayesian networks which model all features.",0
"Title: Efficient Algorithms for Learning to Play Repeated Games Against Computationally Bounded Adversaries  
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently learning to play a game optimally against an unknown adversary chosen from a computationally bounded class. We both contribute to the line of research on playing games against finite automata, and expand the scope of this research by considering new classes of adversaries. We introduce the natural notions of games against recent history adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple boolean formula on the recent history of play), and games against statistical adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple function of the statistics of the entire history of play). In both cases we give efficient algorithms for learning to play penny-matching and a more difficult game called contract . We also give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata, an efficient algorithm for learning to play any game against any finite automata with probabilistic actions and low cover time. ","Title: A Constraint-Based Approach to Preference Elicitation and Decision Making  
Abstract: We investigate the solution of constraint-based configuration problems in which the preference function over outcomes is unknown or incompletely specified. The aim is to configure a system, such as a personal computer, so that it will be optimal for a given user. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that generate the most preferred feasible configuration by posing preference queries to the user. In order to minimize the number and the complexity of preference queries posed to the user, the algorithm reasons about the user's preferences while taking into account constraints over the set of feasible configurations. We assume that the user can structure their preferences in a particular way that, while natural in many settings, can be exploited during the optimization process. We also address in a preliminary fashion the trade-offs between computational effort in the solution of a problem and the degree of interaction with the user. ",0
"Title: Regularities in a Random Mapping from Orthography to Semantics  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate representational and methodological issues in a attractor network model of the mapping from orthography to semantics based on [Plaut, 1995]. We find that, contrary to psycholinguistic studies, the response time to concrete words (represented by more 1 bits in the output pattern) is slower than for abstract words. This model also predicts that response times to words in a dense semantic neighborhood will be faster than words which have few semantically similar neighbors in the language. This is conceptually consistent with the neighborhood effect seen in the mapping from orthography to phonology [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989, Plaut et al., 1996] in that patterns with many neighbors are faster in both pathways, but since there is no regularity in the random mapping used here, it is clear that the cause of this effect is different than that of previous experiments. We also report a rather distressing finding. Reaction time in this model is measured by the time it takes the network to settle after being presented with a new input. When the criterion used to determine when the network is settled is changed to include testing of the hidden units, each of the results reported above change the direction of effect abstract words are now slower, as are words in dense semantic neighborhoods. Since there are independent reasons to exclude hidden units from the stopping criterion, and this is what is done in common practice, we believe this phenomenon to be of interest mostly to neural network practitioners. However, it does provide some insight into the interaction between the hidden and output units during settling. ","Title: Symposium Title: Tutorial Discourse What Makes Human Explanations Effective?  
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art ILP systems require large numbers of negative examples to avoid overgeneralization. This is a considerable disadvantage for many ILP applications, namely indu ctive program synthesis where relativelly small and sparse example sets are a more realistic scenario. Integrity constraints are first order clauses that can play the role of negative examples in an inductive process. One integrity constraint can replace a long list of ground negative examples. However, checking the consistency of a program with a set of integrity constraints usually involves heavy the orem-proving. We propose an efficient constraint satisfaction algorithm that applies to a wide variety of useful integrity constraints and uses a Monte Carlo strategy. It looks for inconsistencies by ra ndom generation of queries to the program. This method allows the use of integrity constraints instead of (or together with) negative examples. As a consequence programs to induce can be specified more rapidly by the user and the ILP system tends to obtain more accurate definitions. Average running times are not greatly affected by the use of integrity constraints compared to ground negative examples. ",0

Abstract: Frank Smieja Report number: 1993/2 ","Title: Beyond predictive accuracy: what?  
Abstract: Today's potential users of machine learning technology are faced with the non-trivial problem of choosing, from the large, ever-increasing number of available tools, the one most appropriate for their particular task. To assist the often non-initiated users, it is desirable that this model selection process be automated. Using experience from base level learning, researchers have proposed meta-learning as a possible solution. Historically, predictive accuracy has been the de facto criterion, with most work in meta-learning focusing on the discovery of rules that match applications to models based on accuracy only. Although predictive accuracy is clearly an important criterion, it is also the case that there are a number of other criteria that could, and often ought to, be considered when learning about model selection. This paper presents a number of such criteria and discusses the impact they have on meta-level approaches to model selection.",0
"Title: Improving accuracy by combining rule-based and case-based reasoning  
Abstract: An architecture is presented for combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. The architecture is intended for domains that are understood reasonably well, but still imperfectly. It uses a set of rules, which are taken to be only approximately correct, to obtain a preliminary answer for a given problem; it then draws analogies from cases to handle exceptions to the rules. Having rules together with cases not only increases the architecture's domain coverage, it also allows innovative ways of doing case-based reasoning: the same rules that are used for rule-based reasoning are also used by the case-based component to do case indexing and case adaptation. The architecture was applied to the task of name pronunciation, and, with minimal knowledge engineering, was found to perform almost at the level of the best commercial systems. Moreover, its accuracy was found to exceed what it could have achieved with rules or cases alone, thus demonstrating the accuracy improvement afforded by combining rule-based and case-based reasoning.

"Title: Scaling Reinforcement Learning Algorithms by Learning Variable Temporal Resolution Models  
Abstract: The close connection between reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms has fueled research on RL within the machine learning community. Yet, despite increased theoretical understanding, RL algorithms remain applicable to simple tasks only. In this paper I use the abstract framework afforded by the connection to dynamic programming to discuss the scaling issues faced by RL researchers. I focus on learning agents that have to learn to solve multiple structured RL tasks in the same environment. I propose learning abstract environment models where the abstract actions represent ""intentions"" of achieving a particular state. Such models are variable temporal resolution models because in different parts of the state space the abstract actions span different number of time steps. The operational definitions of abstract actions can be learned incrementally using repeated experience at solving RL tasks. I prove that under certain conditions solutions to new RL tasks can be found by using simu lated experience with abstract actions alone.","Title: Bayesian Design for the Normal Linear Model with Unknown Error Variance  
Abstract: Most of the Bayesian theory of optimal experimental design, for the normal linear model, has been developed under the restrictive assumption that the variance is known. In special cases, insensitivity of specific design criteria to specific prior assumptions on the variance has been demonstrated, but a general result to show the way in which Bayesian optimal designs are affected by prior information about the variance is lacking. This paper stresses the important distinction between expected utility functions and optimality criteria, examines a number of expected utility functions some of which possess interesting properties, and deserve wider use and derives the relevant Bayesian optimality criteria under normal assumptions. This unifying setup is useful for proving the main result of the paper, that clarifies the issue of designing for the normal linear model with unknown variance. ",0
"Title: Exploratory Learning in the Game of GO  
Abstract: This paper considers the importance of exploration to game-playing programs which learn by playing against opponents. The central question is whether a learning program should play the move which offers the best chance of winning the present game, or if it should play the move which has the best chance of providing useful information for future games. An approach to addressing this question is developed using probability theory, and then implemented in two different learning methods. Initial experiments in the game of Go suggest that a program which takes exploration into account can learn better against a knowledgeable opponent than a program which does not.

Appropriate control rules are learned using a new first-order induction algorithm that automatically invents useful syntactic and semantic categories. Empirical results show that the learned parsers generalize well to novel sentences and out-perform previous approaches based on connectionist techniques. ",0

"Title: A Knowledge-Based Framework for Belief Change Part I: Foundations  
Abstract: We propose a general framework in which to study belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility: an agent believes ' if he knows that ' is true in all the worlds he considers most plausible. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge, plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of Halpern and Fagin [HF89] for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We show that our framework is quite expressive and lets us model in a natural way a number of different scenarios for belief change. For example, we show how we can capture an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated by ""conditioning"". In a related paper, we show how the two best studied scenarios, belief revision and belief update, fit into the framework.

The results are readily extended to (binary) belief networks. For belief networks we also derive closed form posteriors in the presence of missing values. Finally, we show that the dual of the regression problem gives a latent variable density model, the variational formulation of which leads to exactly solvable EM updates.","Title: A Self-Organizing Binary Decision Tree For Incrementally Defined Rule Based  
Abstract: This paper presents an ASOCS (adaptive self-organizing concurrent system) model for massively parallel processing of incrementally defined rule systems in such areas as adaptive logic, robotics, logical inference, and dynamic control. An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. This paper focuses on adaptive algorithm 3 (AA3) and details its architecture and learning algorithm. It has advantages over previous ASOCS models in simplicity, implementability, and cost. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During the data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit. In learning mode, rules expressed as boolean conjunctions are incrementally presented to the ASOCS. All ASOCS learning algorithms incorporate a new rule in a distributed fashion in a short, bounded time. ",0
"Title: Threaded Multiple Path Execution  
Abstract: This paper presents Threaded Multi-Path Execution (TME), which exploits existing hardware on a Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) processor to speculatively execute multiple paths of execution. When there are fewer threads in an SMT processor than hardware contexts, threaded multi-path execution uses spare contexts to fetch and execute code along the less likely path of hard-to-predict branches. This paper describes the hardware mechanisms needed to enable an SMT processor to efficiently spawn speculative threads for threaded multi-path execution. The Mapping Synchronization Bus is described, which enables the spawning of these multiple paths. Policies are examined for deciding which branches to fork, and for managing competition between primary and alternate path threads for critical resources. Our results show that TME increases the single program performance of an SMT with eight thread contexts by 14%-23% on average, depending on the misprediction penalty, for programs with a high misprediction rate.

Abstract: ICSIM is a connectionist net simulator being developed at ICSI and written in Sather. It is object-oriented to meet the requirements for flexibility and reuse of homogeneous and structured connectionist nets and to allow the user to encapsulate efficient customized implementations perhaps running on dedicated hardware. Nets are composed by combining off-the-shelf library classes and if necessary by specializing some of their behaviour. General user interface classes allow a uniform or customized graphic presentation of the nets being modeled. ",0
"Title: Framework for Combining Symbolic and Neural Learning rule extraction from neural networks the KBANN algorithm
Abstract: Technical Report 1123, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Nov. 1992 ABSTRACT This article describes an approach to combining symbolic and connectionist approaches to machine learning. A three-stage framework is presented and the research of several groups is reviewed with respect to this framework. The first stage involves the insertion of symbolic knowledge into neural networks, the second addresses the refinement of this prior knowledge in its neural representation, while the third concerns the extraction of the refined symbolic knowledge. Experimental results and open research issues are discussed. A shorter version of this paper will appear in Machine Learning. ","Title: Local Selection  
Abstract: Local selection (LS) is a very simple selection scheme in evolutionary algorithms. Individual fitnesses are compared to a fixed threshold, rather than to each other, to decide who gets to reproduce. LS, coupled with fitness functions stemming from the consumption of shared environmental resources, maintains diversity in a way similar to fitness sharing; however it is generally more efficient than fitness sharing, and lends itself to parallel implementations for distributed tasks. While LS is not prone to premature convergence, it applies minimal selection pressure upon the population. LS is therefore more appropriate than other, stronger selection schemes only on certain problem classes. This papers characterizes one broad class of problems in which LS consistently out performs tournament selection.",0
"Title: Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers  
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular techniques for processing, compressing and visualising data, although its effectiveness is limited by its global linearity. While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have therefore to some extent been ad hoc. In this paper, PCA is formulated within a maximum-likelihood framework, based on a specific form of Gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analysers, whose parameters can be determined using an EM algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modelling and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition. ","Title: A Graphical Characterization of Lattice Conditional Independence Models  
Abstract: Lattice conditional independence (LCI) models for multivariate normal data recently have been introduced for the analysis of non-monotone missing data patterns and of nonnested dependent linear regression models ( seemingly unrelated regressions). It is shown here that the class of LCI models coincides with a subclass of the class of graphical Markov models determined by acyclic digraphs (ADGs), namely, the subclass of transitive ADG models. An explicit graph - theoretic characterization of those ADGs that are Markov equivalent to some transitive ADG is obtained. This characterization allows one to determine whether a specific ADG D is Markov equivalent to some transitive ADG, hence to some LCI model, in polynomial time, without an exhaustive search of the (exponentially large) equivalence class [D ]. These results do not require the existence or positivity of joint densities.",0
"Title: Learning Recursive Sequences via Evolution of Machine-Language Programs  
Abstract: We use directed search techniques in the space of computer programs to learn recursive sequences of positive integers. Specifically, the integer sequences of squares, x 2 ; cubes, x 3 ; factorial, x!; and Fibonacci numbers are studied. Given a small finite prefix of a sequence, we show that three directed searches|machine-language genetic programming with crossover, exhaustive iterative hill climbing, and a hybrid (crossover and hill climbing)|can automatically discover programs that exactly reproduce the finite target prefix and, moreover, that correctly produce the remaining sequence up to the underlying machine's precision. Our machine-language representation is generic|it contains instructions for arithmetic, register manipulation and comparison, and control flow. We also introduce an output instruction that allows variable-length sequences as result values. Importantly, this representation does not contain recursive operators; recursion, when needed, is automatically synthesized from primitive instructions. For a fixed set of search parameters (e.g., instruction set, program size, fitness criteria), we compare the efficiencies of the three directed search techniques on the four sequence problems. For this parameter set, an evolutionary-based search always outperforms exhaustive hill climbing as well as undirected random search. Since only the prefix of the target sequence is variable in our experiments, we posit that this approach to sequence induction is potentially quite general. ","Title: 82 Lag-space estimation in time-series modelling keep track of cases where the estimation of P
Abstract: When m = 0 (no delays), we set A 0 (ffi) = f(j; k) ; j 6= kg, such that P m (*jffi) depends only on *. The estimated probabilities above become quite noisy when the number of elements in set A m and B m are small. For this reason, we estimate the standard deviation of P m (*jffi). Notice that this estimate is the empirical average of a binomial variable (either a given couple satisfied the conditions on ffi and *, or it does not). The standard deviation is then estimated easily by: Generally speaking, P m (*jffi) increases with * (laxer output test), and when ffi approaches 0 (stricter input condition). Let us now define by P m (*) the maximum over ffi of P m (*jffi): P m (*) = max ffi&gt;0 P m (*jffi). The dependability index is defined as: P 0 (*) represents how much data passes the continuity test when no input information is available. This dependability index measures how much of the remaining continuity information is associated with involving input i m . This index is then averaged over * with respect to the probability (1 P 0 (*)): m (*) (1 P 0 (*)) d* (4.8) It is clear that m (*), and therefore its average, should be positive quantities. Furthermore, if the system is deterministic, the dependability is zero after a certain number of inputs, so the sum of averages saturates. If the system is also noise-free, they sum up to 1. For any m greater than the embedding dimension: refers to results obtained using this method. 4.6 Statistical variable selection Statistical variable selection (or feature selection) encompasses a number of techniques aimed at choosing a relevant subset of input variables in a regression or a classification problem. As in the rest of this document, we will limit ourselves to considerations related to the regression problem, even though most methods discussed below apply to classification as well. Variable selection can be seen as a part of the data analysis problem: the selection (or discard) of a variable tells us about the relevance of the associated measurement to the modelled system. In a general setting, this is a purely combinatorial problem: given V possible variables, there is 2 V possible subsets (including the empty set and the full set) of these variables. Given a performance measure, such as prediction error, the only optimal scheme is to test all these subset and choose the one that gives the best performance. It is easy to see that such an extensive scheme is only viable when the number of variables is rather low. Identifying 2 V models when we have more than a few variables requires too much computation. A number of techniques have been devised to overcome this combinatorial limit. Some of them use an iterative, locally optimal technique to construct an estimate of the relevant subset in a number of steps. We will refer to them as stepwise selection methods, not to be con fused with stepwise regression, a subset of these methods that we will address below. In forward selection, we start with an empty set of variables. At each step, we select a candidate variable using a selection criteria, check whether this variable should be added to the set, and iterate until a given stop condition is reached. On the contrary, backward elimination methods start with the full set of all input variables. At each step, the least significant variable is selected according to a selection criteria. If this variable is irrelevant, it is removed and the process is iterated until a stop condition is reached. It is easy to devise examples where the inclusion of a variable causes a previously included variable to become irrelevant. It thus seems appropriate to consider running a backward elimination each time a new variable is added by forward selection. This combination of both ap proaches is known as stepwise regression in the linear regression con",0
"Title: MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning  
Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T0 [4], a vector processor with a fixed point engine, designed for neural network simulation. A matrix formulation of back prop, Matrix Back Prop [1], has been shown to be very efficient on some RISCs [2]. Using Matrix Back Prop, we achieve an asymptotically optimal performance on T0 (about 0.8 GOPS) for both forward and backward phases, which is not possible with the standard on-line method. Since high efficiency is futile if convergence is poor (due to the use of fixed point arithmetic), we use a mixture of fixed and floating point operations. The key observation is that the precision of fixed point is sufficient for good convergence, if the range is appropriately chosen. Though the most expensive computations are implemented in fixed point, we achieve a rate of convergence that is comparable to the floating point version. The time taken for conversion between fixed and floating point is also shown to be reasonable. ","Title: Predicting Conditional Probability Distributions: A Connectionist Approach  
Abstract: Most traditional prediction techniques deliver the mean of the probability distribution (a single point). For multimodal processes, instead of predicting the mean of the probability distribution, it is important to predict the full distribution. This article presents a new connectionist method to predict the conditional probability distribution in response to an input. The main idea is to transform the problem from a regression to a classification problem. The conditional probability distribution network can perform both direct predictions and iterated predictions, a task which is specific for time series problems. We compare our method to fuzzy logic and discuss important differences, and also demonstrate the architecture on two time series. The first is the benchmark laser series used in the Santa Fe competition, a deterministic chaotic system. The second is a time series from a Markov process which exhibits structure on two time scales. The network produces multimodal predictions for this series. We compare the predictions of the network with a nearest-neighbor predictor and find that the conditional probability network is more than twice as likely a model.",0
"Title: STRUCTURAL LEARNING OF FUZZY RULES FROM NOISED EXAMPLES

The algorithm gives a reasonable small set of fuzzy rules that represent the original set of examples. ","Title: Factor Analysis Using Delta-Rule Wake-Sleep Learning  
Abstract: Technical Report No. 9607, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto We describe a linear network that models correlations between real-valued visible variables using one or more real-valued hidden variables a factor analysis model. This model can be seen as a linear version of the Helmholtz machine, and its parameters can be learned using the wake-sleep method, in which learning of the primary generative model is assisted by a recognition model, whose role is to fill in the values of hidden variables based on the values of visible variables. The generative and recognition models are jointly learned in wake and sleep phases, using just the delta rule. This learning procedure is comparable in simplicity to Oja's version of Hebbian learning, which produces a somewhat different representation of correlations in terms of principal components. We argue that the simplicity of wake-sleep learning makes factor analysis a plau sible alternative to Hebbian learning as a model of activity-dependent cortical plasticity.",0
"Title: Learning Control Knowledge in Models of Expertise ECML'95 Workshop on Knowledge-Level Modelling and Machine Learning  
Abstract: During the development and the life-cycle of knowledge-based systems the requirements on the system and the knowledge in the system will change. One of the types of knowledge affected by changing requirements is control-knowledge, which prescribes the ordering of problem-solving steps. Machine-learning can aid developers of knowledge-based systems in adapting their systems to changing requirements. A number of machine-learning techniques for learning control-knowledge have been applied to problem-solvers (Prodigy-EBL, LEX). In knowledge engineering, the focus has shifted to the construction of knowledge-level models of problem-solving instead of directly constructing a knowledge-based system in a problem-solver. In this paper we describe work in progress on how to apply machine learning techniques to the KADS model of expertise.","Title: Linear Machine Decision Trees

"Title: Constructive Belief and Rational Representation  
Abstract: It is commonplace in artificial intelligence to divide an agent's explicit beliefs into two parts: the beliefs explicitly represented or manifest in memory, and the implicitly represented or constructive beliefs that are repeatedly reconstructed when needed rather than memorized. Many theories of knowledge view the relation between manifest and constructive beliefs as a logical relation, with the manifest beliefs representing the constructive beliefs through a logic of belief. This view, however, limits the ability of a theory to treat incomplete or inconsistent sets of beliefs in useful ways. We argue that a more illuminating view is that belief is the result of rational representation. In this theory, the agent obtains its constructive beliefs by using its manifest beliefs and preferences to rationally (in the sense of decision theory) choose the most useful conclusions indicated by the manifest beliefs.","Title: Case Retrieval Nets: Basic Ideas and Extensions

The main idea is to apply a spreading activation process to a net-like case memory in order to retrieve cases being similar to a posed query case. We summarize the basic ideas of CRNs, suggest some useful extensions, and present some initial experimental results which suggest that CRNs can successfully handle case bases larger than considered usually in the CBR community.

"Title: The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut  
Abstract: As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.","Title: Causal diagrams for empirical research

In particular, the paper develops a principled, nonparametric framework for causal inference, in which diagrams are queried to determine if the assumptions available are sufficient for identifying causal effects from nonexperimental data. If so the diagrams can be queried to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be queried to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be obtained. Key words: Causal inference, graph models, structural equations, treatment effect. ",0

Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our aim is to construct an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. The need to merge knowledge bases can arise, for example, when knowledge bases are acquired independently from interactions with several domain experts. As opinions of different domain experts may differ, the knowledge bases constructed in this way will normally differ too. A similar problem can also arise whenever separate knowledge bases are generated by learning algorithms. The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has a good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration, describe the implemented system (INTEG.3), and present some concrete results which demonstrate the advantages of this method. ","Title: Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights  
Abstract: Supervised neural networks generalize well if there is much less information in the weights than there is in the output vectors of the training cases. So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-off between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed efficiently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights.",0

"Title: Knowledge Integration and Rule Extraction in Neural Networks Ph.D. Proposal  
Abstract: One kind of prosodic structure that apparently underlies both music and language is meter. Yet detailed measurements of both music and speech show that the nested periodicities that define metrical structure are noisy in some sense. What kind of system could produce or perceive such variable metrical timing? And what would it take to store particular metrical patterns in the long-term memory of the system? We have developed a network of coupled oscillators that both produces and perceives metrical patterns of pulses. In addition, beginning with an initial state with no biases, it learns to prefer 3-beat patterns (like waltzes) over 2-beat patterns. Models of this general class could learn to entrain to musical patterns. And given a way to process speech to extract appropriate pulses, the model should be applicable to metrical structure in speech as well. Is language metrical? Meter refers both to particular sorts of patterns in time and to an abstract description of such patterns, potentially a cognitive representation of them. In both cases there are two or more hierarchical levels at which equally spaced events occur, and the periods characterizing these levels are integral multiples of each other (usually 2 or 3). The hierarchy is implied in standard Western musical notation, where the different levels are indicated by kinds of notes (quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and by bars separating measures. For example, in a basic waltz-time meter, there are individual beats, all with the same spacing, grouped into sets of three with every third one receiving a stronger accent. In such a meter, there is a hierarchy consisting of both a faster periodic cycle (at the beat level) and a slower one (the measure level) that is 1/3 as fast with its onset (or zero phase angle) coinciding with the zero phase angle of every third beat. Metrical systems like this seem to underlie most forms of music around the world and are often said to underlie human speech as well (Jones, 1932; Martin, 1972). However, an awkward difficulty is that the definition employs the notion of an integer since data on both music and speech show clearly that the perfect temporal ratios predicted by such a definition are not observed in performance. In music performance, various kinds of systematic temporal deviations in the timing specified by musical notation are known to ","Title: Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers

"Title: Choosing Learning Strategies to Achieve Learning Goals  
Abstract: In open world applications a number of machine-learning techniques may potentially apply to a given learning situation. The research presented here illustrates the complexity involved in automatically choosing an appropriate technique in a multistrategy learning system. It also constitutes a step toward a general computational solution to the learning-strategy selection problem. The approach is to treat learning-strategy selection as a separate planning problem with its own set of goals, as is the case with ordinary problem-solvers. Therefore, the management and pursuit of these learning goals becomes a central issue in learning, similar to the goal-management problems associated with traditional planning systems. This paper explores some issues, problems, and possible solutions in such a framework. Examples are presented from a multistrategy learning system called Meta-AQUA.","Title: Learning Algorithms with Applications to Robot Navigation and Protein Folding  
Abstract: Using scene analysis as the task, this research focuses on three fundamental problems in neural network systems: (1) limited processing resources, (2) representing schemas, and (3) learning schemas. The first problem arises because no practical neural network can process all the visual input simultaneously and efficiently. The solution is to process a small amount of the input in parallel, and successively focus on the other parts of the input. This strategy requires that the system maintains structured knowledge for describing and interpreting the gathered information. The system should also learn to represent structured knowledge from examples of objects and scenes. VISOR, the system described in this paper, consists of three main components. The Low-Level Visual Module (simulated using procedural programs) extracts featural and positional information from the visual input. The Schema Module encodes structured knowledge about possible objects, and provides top-down information for the Low-Level Visual Module to focus attention at different parts of the scene. The Response Module learns to associate the schema activation patterns with external responses. It enables the external environment to provide reinforcement feedback for the learning of schematic structures. ",0
"Title: EXPLANATORY INTERFACE IN INTERACTIVE DESIGN ENVIRONMENTS  
Abstract: Explanation is an important issue in building computer-based interactive design environments in which a human designer and a knowledge system may cooperatively solve a design problem. We consider the two related problems of explaining the system's reasoning and the design generated by the system. In particular, we analyze the content of explanations of design reasoning and design solutions in the domain of physical devices. We describe two complementary languages: task-method-knowledge models for explaining design reasoning, and structure-behavior-function models for explaining device designs. INTERACTIVE KRITIK is a computer program that uses these representations to visually illustrate the system's reasoning and the result of a design episode. The explanation of design reasoning in INTERACTIVE KRITIK is in the context of the evolving design solution, and, similarly, the explanation of the design solution is in the context of the design reasoning. ","Title: Evolution in Time and Space The Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modifications compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.",0

We give an algorithm to determine the largest possible number of leaves in any agreement subtree of two trees T 1 and T 2 with n leaves each. If the maximum degree d of these trees is bounded by a constant, the time complexity is O(n log 2 n) and is within a log n factor of optimal. For general d, this algorithm runs in O(nd 2 log d log 2 n) time or alternately in O(nd p d log 3 n) time. ",0
"Title: Efficient Learning of Selective Bayesian Network Classifiers  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computation-ally efficient method for inducing selective Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach is to use information-theoretic metrics to efficiently select a subset of attributes from which to learn the classifier. We explore three conditional, information-theoretic met-rics that are extensions of metrics used extensively in decision tree learning, namely Quin-lan's gain and gain ratio metrics and Man-taras's distance metric. We experimentally show that the algorithms based on gain ratio and distance metric learn selective Bayesian networks that have predictive accuracies as good as or better than those learned by existing selective Bayesian network induction approaches (K2-AS), but at a significantly lower computational cost. We prove that the subset-selection phase of these information-based algorithms has polynomial complexity, as compared to the worst-case exponential time complexity of the corresponding phase in K2-AS.","Title: Submitted to NIPS96, Section: Applications. Preference: Oral presentation Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Channel Allocation in
Abstract: In cellular telephone systems, an important problem is to dynamically allocate the communication resource (channels) so as to maximize service in a stochastic caller environment. This problem is naturally formulated as a dynamic programming problem and we use a reinforcement learning (RL) method to find dynamic channel allocation policies that are better than previous heuristic solutions. The policies obtained perform well for a broad variety of call traffic patterns. We present results on a large cellular system In cellular communication systems, an important problem is to allocate the communication resource (bandwidth) so as to maximize the service provided to a set of mobile callers whose demand for service changes stochastically. A given geographical area is divided into mutually disjoint cells, and each cell serves the calls that are within its boundaries (see Figure 1a). The total system bandwidth is divided into channels, with each channel centered around a frequency. Each channel can be used simultaneously at different cells, provided these cells are sufficiently separated spatially, so that there is no interference between them. The minimum separation distance between simultaneous reuse of the same channel is called the channel reuse constraint . When a call requests service in a given cell either a free channel (one that does not violate the channel reuse constraint) may be assigned to the call, or else the call is blocked from the system; this will happen if no free channel can be found. Also, when a mobile caller crosses from one cell to another, the call is ""handed off"" to the cell of entry; that is, a new free channel is provided to the call at the new cell. If no such channel is available, the call must be dropped/disconnected from the system. One objective of a channel allocation policy is to allocate the available channels to calls so that the number of blocked calls is minimized. An additional objective is to minimize the number of calls that are dropped when they are handed off to a busy cell. These two objectives must be weighted appropriately to reflect their relative importance, since dropping existing calls is generally more undesirable than blocking new calls. with approximately 70 49 states.",0
"Title: VISIT: An Efficient Computational Model of Human Visual Attention  
Abstract: One of the challenges for models of cognitive phenomena is the development of efficient and exible interfaces between low level sensory information and high level processes. For visual processing, researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many of the tasks required by high level vision. This thesis presents VISIT, a connectionist model of covert visual attention that has been used as a vehicle for studying this interface. The model is efficient, exible, and is biologically plausible. The complexity of the network is linear in the number of pixels. Effective parallel strategies are used to minimize the number of iterations required. The resulting system is able to efficiently solve two tasks that are particularly difficult for standard bottom-up models of vision: computing spatial relations and visual search. Simulations show that the networks behavior matches much of the known psychophysical data on human visual attention. The general architecture of the model also closely matches the known physiological data on the human attention system. Various extensions to VISIT are discussed, including methods for learning the component modules. ","Title: Segmenting Time Series using Gated Experts with Simulated Annealing  
Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.",0
"Title: Evolving Compact Solutions in Genetic Programming: A Case Study  
Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) is a variant of genetic algorithms where the data structures handled are trees. This makes GP especially useful for evolving functional relationships or computer programs, as both can be represented as trees. Symbolic regression is the determination of a function dependence y = g(x) that approximates a set of data points (x i ; y i ). In this paper the feasibility of symbolic regression with GP is demonstrated on two examples taken from different domains. Furthermore several suggested methods from literature are compared that are intended to improve GP performance and the readability of solutions by taking into account introns or redundancy that occurs in the trees and keeping the size of the trees small.

This effectively decomposes the problem into smaller, less complex problems. The method is inspired by the Boolean function decomposition approach to the design of digital circuits. To cope with high time complexity of finding an optimal decomposition, we propose a suboptimal heuristic algorithm. The method, implemented in program HINT (HIerarchy Induction Tool), is experimentally evaluated using a set of artificial and real-world learning problems. It is shown that the method performs well both in terms of classification accuracy and discovery of meaningful concept hierarchies.",0
"Title: Error-Correcting Output Coding Corrects Bias and Variance  
Abstract: Previous research has shown that a technique called error-correcting output coding (ECOC) can dramatically improve the classification accuracy of supervised learning algorithms that learn to classify data points into one of k 2 classes. This paper presents an investigation of why the ECOC technique works, particularly when employed with decision-tree learning algorithms. It shows that the ECOC method| like any form of voting or committee|can reduce the variance of the learning algorithm. Furthermore|unlike methods that simply combine multiple runs of the same learning algorithm|ECOC can correct for errors caused by the bias of the learning algorithm. Experiments show that this bias correction ability relies on the non-local be havior of C4.5.","Title: THE EXPANDABLE SPLIT WINDOW PARADIGM FOR EXPLOITING FINE-GRAIN PARALLELISM  
Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split Window (ESW) paradigm, for exploiting fine-grain parallelism. This paradigm considers a window of instructions (possibly having dependencies) as a single unit, and exploits fine-grain parallelism by overlapping the execution of multiple windows. The basic idea is to connect multiple sequential processors, in a decoupled and decentralized manner, to achieve overall multiple issue. This processing paradigm shares a number of properties of the restricted dataflow machines, but was derived from the sequential von Neumann architecture. We also present an implementation of the Expandable Split Window execution model, and preliminary performance results. ",0
"Title: On Learning Visual Concepts and DNF Formulae  
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning DNF formulae in the mistake-bound and the PAC models. We develop a new approach, which is called polynomial explainability, that is shown to be useful for learning some new subclasses of DNF (and CNF) formulae that were not known to be learnable before. Unlike previous learnability results for DNF (and CNF) formulae, these subclasses are not limited in the number of terms or in the number of variables per term; yet, they contain the subclasses of k-DNF and k-term-DNF (and the corresponding classes of CNF) as special cases. We apply our DNF results to the problem of learning visual concepts and obtain learning algorithms for several natural subclasses of visual concepts that appear to have no natural boolean counterpart. On the other hand, we show that learning some other natural subclasses of visual concepts is as hard as learning the class of all DNF formulae. We also consider the robustness of these results under various types of noise. ","Title: Active Gesture Recognition using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes  
Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 367 Appeared 13th IEEE Intl. Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR '96), Vienna, Austria. Abstract We present a foveated gesture recognition system that guides an active camera to foveate salient features based on a reinforcement learning paradigm. Using vision routines previously implemented for an interactive environment, we determine the spatial location of salient body parts of a user and guide an active camera to obtain images of gestures or expressions. A hidden-state reinforcement learning paradigm based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is used to implement this visual attention. The attention module selects targets to foveate based on the goal of successful recognition, and uses a new multiple-model Q-learning formulation. Given a set of target and distractor gestures, our system can learn where to foveate to maximally discriminate a particular gesture.",0

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm, in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed. ",0
"Title: Temporal Compositional Processing by a DSOM Hierarchical Model  
Abstract: Any intelligent system, whether human or robotic, must be capable of dealing with patterns over time. Temporal pattern processing can be achieved if the system has a short-term memory capacity (STM) so that different representations can be maintained for some time. In this work we propose a neural model wherein STM is realized by leaky integrators in a self-organizing system. The model exhibits composition-ality, that is, it has the ability to extract and construct progressively complex and structured associations in an hierarchical manner, starting with basic and primitive (temporal) elements.","Title: Learning Problem-Solving Concepts by Reflecting on Problem Solving  
Abstract: Learning and problem solving are intimately related: problem solving determines the knowledge requirements of the reasoner which learning must fulfill, and learning enables improved problem-solving performance. Different models of problem solving, however, recognize different knowledge needs, and, as a result, set up different learning tasks. Some recent models analyze problem solving in terms of generic tasks, methods, and subtasks. These models require the learning of problem-solving concepts such as new tasks and new task decompositions. We view reflection as a core process for learning these problem-solving concepts. In this paper, we identify the learning issues raised by the task-structure framework of problem solving. We view the problem solver as an abstract device, and represent how it works in terms of a structure-behavior-function model which specifies how the knowledge and reasoning of the problem solver results in the accomplishment of its tasks. We describe how this model enables reflection, and how model-based reflection enables the reasoner to adapt its task structure to produce solutions of better quality. The Autognostic system illustrates this reflection process. ",0

Abstract: Summary. We analyze a hierarchical Bayes model which is related to the usual empirical Bayes formulation of James-Stein estimators. We consider running a Gibbs sampler on this model. Using previous results about convergence rates of Markov chains, we provide rigorous, numerical, reasonable bounds on the running time of the Gibbs sampler, for a suitable range of prior distributions. We apply these results to baseball data from Efron and Morris (1975). For a different range of prior distributions, we prove that the Gibbs sampler will fail to converge, and use this information to prove that in this case the associated posterior distribution is non-normalizable.

"Title: Associative Reinforcement Learning: Functions in k-DNF  
Abstract: An agent that must learn to act in the world by trial and error faces the reinforcement learning problem, which is quite different from standard concept learning. Although good algorithms exist for this problem in the general case, they are often quite inefficient and do not exhibit generalization. One strategy is to find restricted classes of action policies that can be learned more efficiently. This paper pursues that strategy by developing algorithms that can efficiently learn action maps that are expressible in k-DNF. The algorithms are compared with existing methods in empirical trials and are shown to have very good performance. ","Title: Hierarchical priors and mixture models, with application in regression and density estimation  
Abstract: We have integrated the distributed search of genetic programming (GP) based systems with collective memory to form a collective adaptation search method. Such a system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. Since the pure GP approach does not scale well with problem complexity, a natural question is which of the two components is actually contributing to the search process. We investigate a collective memory search which utilizes a random search engine and find that it significantly outperforms the GP based search engine. We examine the solution space and show that as problem complexity and search space grow, a collective adaptive system will perform better than a collective memory search employing random search as an engine.",0

"Title: [12] J. Whittaker. Graphical Models in Applied Mathematical Multivariate Statis-  
Abstract: Self-organizing feature maps are usually implemented by abstracting the low-level neural and parallel distributed processes. An external supervisor finds the unit whose weight vector is closest in Euclidian distance to the input vector and determines the neighborhood for weight adaptation. The weights are changed proportional to the Euclidian distance. In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved. It is also necessary to add a redundant dimension to the input vectors.","Title: Case-Based Similarity Assessment: Estimating Adaptability from Experience  
Abstract: Case-based problem-solving systems rely on similarity assessment to select stored cases whose solutions are easily adaptable to fit current problems. However, widely-used similarity assessment strategies, such as evaluation of semantic similarity, can be poor predictors of adaptability. As a result, systems may select cases that are difficult or impossible for them to adapt, even when easily adaptable cases are available in memory. This paper presents a new similarity assessment approach which couples similarity judgments directly to a case library containing the system's adaptation knowledge. It examines this approach in the context of a case-based planning system that learns both new plans and new adaptations. Empirical tests of alternative similarity assessment strategies show that this approach enables better case selection and increases the benefits accrued from learned adaptations. ",0
"Title: Using a Genetic Algorithm to Learn Strategies for Collision Avoidance and Local Navigation  
Abstract: Navigation through obstacles such as mine fields is an important capability for autonomous underwater vehicles. One way to produce robust behavior is to perform projective planning. However, real-time performance is a critical requirement in navigation. What is needed for a truly autonomous vehicle are robust reactive rules that perform well in a wide variety of situations, and that also achieve real-time performance. In this work, SAMUEL, a learning system based on genetic algorithms, is used to learn high-performance reactive strategies for navigation and collision avoidance. ","Title: Characterising Innateness in Artificial and Natural Learning  
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a refinement of the notion of innateness. If we merely identify innateness with bias, then we obtain a poor characterisation of this notion, since any learning device relies on a bias that makes it choose a given hypothesis instead of another. We show that our intuition of innateness is better captured by a characteristic of bias, related to isotropy. Generalist models of learning are shown to rely on an isotropic bias, whereas the bias of specialised models, which include some specific a priori knowledge about what is to be learned, is necessarily anisotropic. The socalled generalist models, however, turn out to be specialised in some way: they learn symmetrical forms preferentially, and have strictly no deficiencies in their learning ability. Because some learning beings do not always show these two properties, such generalist models may be sometimes ruled out as bad candidates for cognitive modelling. ",0
"Title: Simple Genetic Programming for Supervised Learning Problems  
Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary approach to finding learning rules to several supervised tasks. In this approach potential solutions are represented as variable length mathematical LISP S-expressions. Thus, it is similar to Genetic Programming (GP) but it employs a fixed set of non-problem-specific functions to solve a variety of problems. In this paper three Monk's and parity problems are tested. The results indicate the usefulness of the encoding schema in discovering learning rules for supervised learning problems with the emphasis on hard learning problems. The problems and future research directions are discussed within the context of GP practices. ","Title: Learning Boolean Read-Once Formulas over Generalized Bases  
Abstract: A read-once formula is one in which each variable appears on at most a single input. Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski give a polynomial time algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to identify exactly read-once boolean formulas over the basis fAND; OR; NOTg [AHK93]. The goal of this work is to consider natural generalizations of these gates, in order to develop exact identification algorithms for more powerful classes of formulas. We show that read-once formulas over a basis of arbitrary boolean functions of constant fan-in k or less (i.e. any f : f0; 1g 1ck ! f0; 1g) are exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. We show that read-once formulas over the basis of arbitrary symmetric boolean functions are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time in this model. Given standard cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial time identification algorithm for read-twice formulas over either of these bases using membership and equivalence queries. We further show that for any basis class B meeting certain technical conditions, any polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over B can be extended to a polynomial time identification algorithm for read-once formulas over the union of B and the arbitrary functions of fan-in k or less. As a result, read-once formulas over the union of arbitrary symmetric and arbitrary constant fan-in gates are also exactly identifiable in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries.

"Title: Modeling Invention by Analogy in ACT-R  
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of cognition involved in invention, more precisely in the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We propose the use of the Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) language for the representation of invention knowledge; we claim that because SBF has been shown to support a wide range of reasoning about physical devices, it constitutes a plausible account of how an inventor might represent knowledge of an invention. We further propose the use of the ACT-R architecture for the implementation of this model. ACT-R has been shown to very precisely model a wide range of human cognition. We draw upon the architecture for execution of productions and matching of declarative knowledge through spreading activation. Thus we present a model which combines the well-established cognitive validity of ACT-R with the powerful, specialized model-based reasoning methods facilitated by SBF.

All these criteria depend on the assumption that the hypothesis space is correct, which may prove to be their main weakness. ",0
"Title: Regression Can Build Predictive Causal Models  
Abstract: Covariance information can help an algorithm search for predictive causal models and estimate the strengths of causal relationships. This information should not be discarded after conditional independence constraints are identified, as is usual in contemporary causal induction algorithms. Our fbd algorithm combines covariance information with an effective heuristic to build predictive causal models. We demonstrate that fbd is accurate and efficient. In one experiment we assess fbd's ability to find the best predictors for variables; in another we compare its performance, using many measures, with Pearl and Verma's ic algorithm. And although fbd is based on multiple linear regression, we cite evidence that it performs well on problems that are very difficult for regression algorithms.

"Title: A Scalable Performance Prediction Method for Parallel Neural Network Simulations  
Abstract: A performance prediction method is presented for indicating the performance range of MIMD parallel processor systems for neural network simulations. The total execution time of a parallel application is modeled as the sum of its calculation and communication times. The method is scalable because based on the times measured on one processor and one communication link, the performance, speedup, and efficiency can be predicted for a larger processor system. It is validated quantitatively by applying it to two popular neural networks, backpropagation and the Kohonen self-organizing feature map, decomposed on a GCel-512, a 512 transputer system. Agreement of the model with the measurements is within 9%.","Title: Inductive Learning by Selection of Minimal Complexity Representations  
Abstract: Behavioural observations can often be described as a sequence of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. However the inductive inference of such strings by any automated technique to produce models of the data is a nontrivial task. This paper considers modelling of behavioural data using probabilistic finite state automata (PFSAs). There are a number of information-theoretic techniques for evaluating possible hypotheses. The measure used in this paper is the Minimum Message Length (MML) of Wallace. Although attempts have been made to construct PFSA models by incremental addition of substrings using heuristic rules and the MML to give the lowest information cost, the resultant models cannot be shown to be globally optimal. Fogel's Evolutionary Programming can produce globally optimal PFSA models by evolving data structures of arbitrary complexity without the requirement to encode the PFSA into binary strings as in Genetic Algorithms. However, evaluation of PFSAs during the evolution process by the MML of the PFSA alone is not possible since there will be symbols which cannot be consumed by a partially correct solution. It is suggested that the addition of a ""can't consume'' symbol to the symbol alphabet obviates this difficulty. The addition of this null symbol to the alphabet also permits the evolution of explanatory models which need not explain all of the data, a useful property to avoid overfitting noisy data. Results are given for a test set for which the optimal pfsa model is known and for a set of eye glance data derived from an instrument panel simulator.",0
"Title: Synchronization and Desynchronization in a Network of Locally Coupled Wilson-Cowan Oscillators  
Abstract: A network of Wilson-Cowan oscillators is constructed, and its emergent properties of synchronization and desynchronization are investigated by both computer simulation and formal analysis. The network is a two-dimensional matrix, where each oscillator is coupled only to its neighbors. We show analytically that a chain of locally coupled oscillators (the piece-wise linear approximation to the Wilson-Cowan oscillator) synchronizes, and present a technique to rapidly entrain finite numbers of oscillators. The coupling strengths change on a fast time scale based on a Hebbian rule. A global separator is introduced which receives input from and sends feedback to each oscillator in the matrix. The global separator is used to desynchronize different oscillator groups. Unlike many other models, the properties of this network emerge from local connections, that preserve spatial relationships among components, and are critical for encoding Gestalt principles of feature grouping. The ability to synchronize and desynchronize oscillator groups within this network offers a promising approach for pattern segmentation and figure/ground segregation based on oscillatory correlation. ","Title: First Order Regression: Applications in Real-World Domains  
Abstract: A first order regression algorithm capable of handling real-valued (continuous) variables is introduced and some of its applications are presented. Regressional learning assumes real-valued class and discrete or real-valued variables. The algorithm combines regressional learning with standard ILP concepts, such as first order concept description and background knowledge. A clause is generated by successively refining the initial clause by adding literals of the form A = v for the discrete attributes, A v and A v for the real-valued attributes, and background knowledge literals to the clause body. The algorithm employs a covering approach (beam search), a heuristic impurity function, and stopping criteria based on local improvement, minimum number of examples, maximum clause length, minimum local improvement, minimum description length, allowed error, and variable depth. An outline of the algorithm and the results of the system's application in some artificial and real-world domains are presented. The real-world domains comprise: modelling of the water behavior in a surge tank, modelling of the workpiece roughness in a steel grinding process and modelling of the operator's behavior during the process of electrical discharge machining. Special emphasis is given to the evaluation of obtained models by domain experts and their comments on the aspects of practical use of the induced knowledge. The results obtained during the knowledge acquisition process show several important guidelines for knowledge acquisition, concerning mainly the process of interaction with domain experts, exposing primarily the importance of comprehensibility of the induced knowledge.",0
"Title: BRACE: A Paradigm For the Discretization of Continuously Valued Data  
Abstract: Discretization of continuously valued data is a useful and necessary tool because many learning paradigms assume nominal data. A list of objectives for efficient and effective discretization is presented. A paradigm called BRACE (Boundary Ranking And Classification Evaluation) that attempts to meet the objectives is presented along with an algorithm that follows the paradigm. The paradigm meets many of the objectives, with potential for extension to meet the remainder. Empirical results have been promising. For these reasons BRACE has potential as an effective and efficient method for discretization of continuously valued data. A further advantage of BRACE is that it is general enough to be extended to other types of clustering/unsupervised learning. ","Title: Unsupervised Constructive Learning  
Abstract: In constructive induction (CI), the learner's problem representation is modified as a normal part of the learning process. This is useful when the initial representation is inadequate or inappropriate. In this paper, I argue that the distinction between constructive and non-constructive methods is unclear. I propose a theoretical model which allows (a) a clean distinction to be made and (b) the process of CI to be properly motivated. I also show that although constructive induction has been used almost exclusively in the context of supervised learning, there is no reason why it cannot form a part of an unsupervised regime.",0

Abstract: When compiling for instruction level parallelism (ILP), the integration of the optimization phases can lead to an improvement in the quality of code generated. However, since several different representations of a program are used in the various phases, only a partial integration has been achieved to date. We present a program representation that combines resource requirements and availability information with control and data dependence information. The representation enables the integration of several optimizing phases, including transformations, register allocation, and instruction scheduling. The basis of this integration is the simultaneous allocation of different types of resources. We define the representation and show how it is constructed. We then formulate several optimization phases to use the representation to achieve better integration. ",0

The learning architecture we use is a one step Q-learning using look-up table, where the inherent parameters are initial Q-values, learning rate, discount rate of rewards, and exploration rate. Under the fitness measure proportioning to the number of times it achieves at the goal in the later half of life, learners evolve through a genetic algorithm. The results of computer simulation indicated that learning ability emerge when the environment changes every generation, and that the inherent map for the optimal path can be acquired when the environment doesn't change. These results suggest that emergence of learning ability needs environmental change faster than alternate generation. ",0

Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor . Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD() for arbitrary , for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using &gt; 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",0
"Title: Probability Estimation via Error-Correcting Output Coding  
Abstract: Previous research has shown that a technique called error-correcting output coding (ECOC) can dramatically improve the classification accuracy of supervised learning algorithms that learn to classify data points into one of k 2 classes. In this paper, we will extend the technique so that ECOC can also provide class probability information. ECOC is a method of converting k-class supervised learning problem into a large number L of two-class supervised learning problems and then combining the results of these L evaluations. The underlying two-class supervised learning algorithms are assumed to provide L probability estimates. The problem of computing class probabilities is formulated as an over-constrained system of L linear equations. Least squares methods are applied to solve these equations. Accuracy and reliability of the probability estimates are demonstrated.","Title: Avoiding overfitting by locally matching the noise level of the data gating network discovers the
Abstract: When trying to forecast the future behavior of a real-world system, two of the key problems are nonstationarity of the process (e.g., regime switching) and overfitting of the model (particularly serious for noisy processes). This articles shows how gated experts can point to solutions to these problems. The architecture, also called society of experts and mixture of experts consists of a (nonlinear) gating network and several (nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns a conditional mean (as usual), but each expert also has its own adaptive width. The gating network learns to assign a probability to each expert that depends on the input. This article first discusses the assumptions underlying this architecture and derives the weight update rules. It then evaluates the performance of gated experts in comparison to that of single networks, as well as to networks with two outputs, one predicting the mean, the other one the local error bar. This article also investigates the ability of gated experts to discover and characterize underlying the regimes. The results are: * there is significantly less overfitting compared to single nets, for two reasons: only subsets of the potential inputs are given to the experts and gating network (less of a curse of dimensionality), and the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels, thus only learning as This article focuses on the architecture and the overfitting problem.

"Title: A Model of Invariant Object Recognition in the Visual System  
Abstract: Neurons in the ventral stream of the primate visual system exhibit responses to the images of objects which are invariant with respect to natural transformations such as translation, size, and view. Anatomical and neurophysiological evidence suggests that this is achieved through a series of hierarchical processing areas. In an attempt to elucidate the manner in which such representations are established, we have constructed a model of cortical visual processing which seeks to parallel many features of this system, specifically the multi-stage hierarchy with its topologically constrained convergent connectivity. Each stage is constructed as a competitive network utilising a modified Hebb-like learning rule, called the trace rule, which incorporates previous as well as current neuronal activity. The trace rule enables neurons to learn about whatever is invariant over short time periods (e.g. 0.5 s) in the representation of objects as the objects transform in the real world. The trace rule enables neurons to learn the statistical invariances about objects during their transformations, by associating together representations which occur close together in time. We show that by using the trace rule training algorithm the model can indeed learn to produce transformation invariant responses to natural stimuli such as faces.","Title: Causal inference, path analysis, and recursive struc-tural equations models.

Abstract: We apply recent results in Markov chain theory to Hastings and Metropolis algorithms with either independent or symmetric candidate distributions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithms to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . In the independence case (in IR k ) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of ; in the symmetric case (in IR only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective. ","Title: 17 Massively Parallel Genetic Programming  
Abstract: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the need for parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary. The transputer-based system presented in the chapter by Koza and Andre ([11]) is one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a data-parallel approach ([20]), although others have exploited workstation farms and pipelined supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of different S-expressions when only a single instruction can be executed at the same time on every processor. The aim of this chapter is to present such an implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where each processor can efficiently evaluate a different S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for scientific experimentation, this is a useful approach. The idea of simulating a MIMD machine using a SIMD architecture is not new ([8, 15]). One of the original ideas for the Connection Machine ([8]) was that it could simulate other parallel architectures. Indeed, in the extreme, each processor on a SIMD architecture can simulate a universal Turing machine (TM). With different turing machine specifications stored in each local memory, each processor would simply have its own tape, tape head, state table and state pointer, and the simulation would be performed by repeating the basic TM operations simultaneously. Of course, such a simulation would be very inefficient, and difficult to program, but would have the advantage of being really MIMD, where no SIMD processor would be in idle state, until its simulated machine halts. Now let us consider an alternative idea, that each SIMD processor would simulate an individual stored program computer using a simple instruction set. For each step of the simulation, the SIMD system would sequentially execute each possible instruction on the subset of processors whose next instruction match it. For a typical assembly language, even with a reduced instruction set, most processors would be idle most of the time. However, if the set of instructions implemented on the virtual processor is very small, this approach can be fruitful. In the case of Genetic Programming, the ""instruction set"" is composed of the specified set of functions designed for the task. We will show below that with a precompilation step, simply adding a push, a conditional, and unconditional branching and a stop instruction, we can get a very effective MIMD simulation running. This chapter reports such an implementation of GP on a MasPar MP-2 parallel computer. The configuration of our system is composed of 4K processor elements ",0
"Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ","Title: Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Temperature Using Smoothing Spline ANOVA  
Abstract: In tasks requiring sustained attention, human alertness varies on a minute time scale. This can have serious consequences in occupations ranging from air traffic control to monitoring of nuclear power plants. Changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum accompany these fluctuations in the level of alertness, as assessed by measuring simultaneous changes in EEG and performance on an auditory monitoring task. By combining power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis and artificial neural networks, we show that continuous, accurate, noninvasive, and near real-time estimation of an operator's global level of alertness is feasible using EEG measures recorded from as few as two central scalp sites. This demonstration could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings. ",0
"Title: The Sources of Increased Accuracy for Two Proposed Boosting Algorithms  
Abstract: We introduce two boosting algorithms that aim to increase the generalization accuracy of a given classifier by incorporating it as a level-0 component in a stacked generalizer. Both algorithms construct a complementary level-0 classifier that can only generate coarse hypotheses for the training data. We show that the two algorithms boost generalization accuracy on a representative collection of data sets. The two algorithms are distinguished in that one of them modifies the class targets of selected training instances in order to train the complementary classifier. We show that the two algorithms achieve approximately equal generalization accuracy, but that they create complementary classifiers that display different degrees of accuracy and diversity. Our study provides evidence that it may be useful to investigate families of boosting algorithms that incorporate varying levels of accuracy and diversity, so as to achieve an appropriate mix for a given task and domain. ","Title: On Structured Variational Approximations  
Abstract: The problem of approximating a probability distribution occurs frequently in many areas of applied mathematics, including statistics, communication theory, machine learning, and the theoretical analysis of complex systems such as neural networks. Saul and Jordan (1996) have recently proposed a powerful method for efficiently approximating probability distributions known as structured variational approximations. In structured variational approximations, exact algorithms for probability computation on tractable substructures are combined with variational methods to handle the interactions between the substructures which make the system as a whole intractable. In this note, I present a mathematical result which can simplify the derivation of struc tured variational approximations in the exponential family of distributions.",0
"Title: Connectionist Modeling of the Fast Mapping Phenomenon  
Abstract: The problem of making optimal decisions in uncertain conditions is central to Artificial Intelligence. If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action, or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning methods, a combination that was very effective in our test cases. ","Title: Separability is a Learner's Best Friend  
Abstract: Geometric separability is a generalisation of linear separability, familiar to many from Minsky and Papert's analysis of the Perceptron learning method. The concept forms a novel dimension along which to conceptualise learning methods. The present paper shows how geometric separability can be defined and demonstrates that it accurately predicts the performance of a at least one empirical learning method.",0
"Title: Efficient Instruction Scheduling Using Finite State Automata  
Abstract: Modern compilers employ sophisticated instruction scheduling techniques to shorten the number of cycles taken to execute the instruction stream. In addition to correctness, the instruction scheduler must also ensure that hardware resources are not oversubscribed in any cycle. For a contemporary processor implementation with multiple pipelines and complex resource usage restrictions, this is not an easy task. The complexity involved in reasoning about such resource hazards is one of the primary factors that constrain the instruction scheduler from performing many aggressive transformations. For example, the ability to do code motion or instruction replacement in the middle of an already scheduled block would be a very powerful transformation if it could be performed efficiently. We extend a technique for detecting pipeline resource hazards based on finite state automata, to support the efficient implementation of such transformations that are essential for aggressive instruction scheduling beyond basic blocks. Although similar code transformations can be supported by other schemes such as reservation tables, our scheme is superior in terms of space and time. A global instruction scheduler that used these techniques was implemented in the KSR compiler. ","Title: Discontinuity in evolution: how different levels of organization imply pre-adaptation  
Abstract: Non-parametric density estimation is the problem of approximating the values of a probability density function, given samples from the associated distribution. Non-parametric estimation finds applications in discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and flow calculations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Usual estimators make use of kernel functions, and require on the order of n 2 arithmetic operations to evaluate the density at n sample points. We describe a sequence of special weight functions which requires almost linear number of operations in n for the same computation. ",0
"Title: A Radial Basis Function Approach to Financial Time Series Analysis  
Abstract: Current systems in the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) use, primarily for the sake of efficiency, heuristically guided search techniques. Such greedy algorithms suffer from local optimization problem. Present paper describes a system named SFOIL, that tries to alleviate this problem by using a stochastic search method, based on a generalization of simulated annealing, called Markovian neural network. Various tests were performed on benchmark, and real-world domains. The results show both, advantages and weaknesses of stochastic approach. ","Title: The Disk-Covering Method for Tree Reconstruction  
Abstract: Evolutionary tree reconstruction is a very important step in many biological research problems, and yet is extremely difficult for a variety of computational, statistical, and scientific reasons. In particular, the reconstruction of very large trees containing significant amounts of divergence is especially challenging. We present in this paper a new tree reconstruction method, which we call the Disk-Covering Method, which can be used to recover accurate estimations of the evolutionary tree for otherwise intractable datasets. DCM obtains a decomposition of the input dataset into small overlapping sets of closely related taxa, reconstructs trees on these subsets (using a ""base"" phylogenetic method of choice), and then combines the subtrees into one tree on the entire set of taxa. Because the subproblems analyzed by DCM are smaller, com-putationally expensive methods such as maximum likelihood estimation can be used without incurring too much cost. At the same time, because the taxa within each subset are closely related, even very simple methods (such as neighbor-joining) are much more likely to be highly accurate. The result is that DCM-boosted methods are typically faster and more accurate as compared to ""naive"" use of the same method. In this paper we describe the basic ideas and techniques in DCM, and demonstrate the advantages of DCM experimentally by simulating sequence evolution on a variety of trees.",0
"Title: Structured Representation of Complex Stochastic Systems  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of representing complex systems that evolve stochastically over time. Dynamic Bayesian networks provide a compact representation for stochastic processes. Unfortunately, they are often unwieldy since they cannot explicitly model the complex organizational structure of many real life systems: the fact that processes are typically composed of several interacting subprocesses, each of which can, in turn, be further decomposed. We propose a hierarchically structured representation language which extends both dynamic Bayesian networks and the object-oriented Bayesian network framework of [9], and show that our language allows us to describe such systems in a natural and modular way. Our language supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. For example, it allows us to represent systems where some processes evolve at a different rate than others, or systems where the processes interact only intermittently. We provide a simple inference mechanism for our representation via translation to Bayesian networks, and suggest ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in our representation. ","Title: Opportunistic Reasoning: A Design Perspective  
Abstract: An essential component of opportunistic behavior is opportunity recognition, the recognition of those conditions that facilitate the pursuit of some suspended goal. Opportunity recognition is a special case of situation assessment, the process of sizing up a novel situation. The ability to recognize opportunities for reinstating suspended problem contexts (one way in which goals manifest themselves in design) is crucial to creative design. In order to deal with real world opportunity recognition, we attribute limited inferential power to relevant suspended goals. We propose that goals suspended in the working memory monitor the internal (hidden) representations of the currently recognized objects. A suspended goal is satisfied when the current internal representation and a suspended goal match. We propose a computational model for working memory and we compare it with other relevant theories of opportunistic planning. This working memory model is implemented as part of our IMPROVISER system. ",0
"Title: CuPit-2: Portable and Efficient High-Level Parallel Programming of Neural Networks for the Systems Analysis Modelling
Abstract: CuPit-2 is a special-purpose programming language designed for expressing dynamic neural network learning algorithms. It provides most of the flexibility of general-purpose languages such as C or C ++ , but is more expressive. It allows writing much clearer and more elegant programs, in particular for algorithms that change the network topology dynamically (constructive algorithms, pruning algorithms). In contrast to other languages, CuPit-2 programs can be compiled into efficient code for parallel machines without any changes in the source program, thus providing an easy start for using parallel platforms. This article analyzes the circumstances under which the CuPit-2 approach is the most useful one, presents a description of most language constructs and reports performance results for CuPit-2 on symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). It concludes that in many cases CuPit-2 is a good basis for neural learning algorithm research on small-scale parallel machines. ","Title: TECHNIQUES FOR REDUCING THE DISRUPTION OF SUPERIOR BUILDING BLOCKS IN GENETIC ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration. Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner.",0
"Title: Self-Organization and Functional Role of Lateral Connections and Multisize Receptive Fields in the Primary Visual Cortex  
Abstract: Cells in the visual cortex are selective not only to ocular dominance and orientation of the input, but also to its size and spatial frequency. The simulations reported in this paper show how size selectivity could develop through Hebbian self-organization, and how receptive fields of different sizes could organize into columns like those for orientation and ocular dominance. The lateral connections in the network self-organize cooperatively and simultaneously with the receptive field sizes, and produce patterns of lateral connectivity that closely follow the receptive field organization. Together with our previous work on ocular dominance and orientation selectivity, these results suggest that a single Hebbian self-organizing process can give rise to all the major receptive field properties in the visual cortex, and also to structured patterns of lateral interactions, some of which have been verified experimentally and others predicted by the model. The model also suggests a functional role for the self-organized structures: The afferent receptive fields develop a sparse coding of the visual input, and the recurrent lateral interactions eliminate redundancies in cortical activity patterns, allowing the cortex to efficiently process massive amounts of visual information. ","Title: Learning polynomials with queries: The highly noisy case  task for the case when F  
Abstract: Given a function f mapping n-variate inputs from a finite field F into F , we consider the task of reconstructing a list of all n-variate degree d polynomials which agree with f on a tiny but non-negligible fraction, ffi, of the input space. We give a randomized algorithm for solving this task which accesses f as a black box and runs in time polynomial in 1 d=jF j). For the special case when d = 1, we solve this problem for all * def jF j &gt; 0. In this case the running time of our algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in 1 * ; n and exponential in d. Our algorithm generalizes a previously known algorithm, due to Goldreich and Levin, that solves this",0
"Title: Forecasting electricity demand using nonlinear mixture of experts  
Abstract: In this paper we study a forecasting model based on mixture of experts for predicting the French electric daily consumption energy. We split the task into two parts. Using mixture of experts, a first model predicts the electricity demand from the exogenous variables (such as temperature and degree of cloud cover) and can be viewed as a nonlinear regression model of mixture of Gaussians. Using a single neural network, a second model predicts the evolution of the residual error of the first one, and can be viewed as an nonlinear autoregression model. We analyze the splitting of the input space generated by the mixture of experts model, and compare the performance to models presently used. ","Title: Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks and PI Control Applied to a Heating Coil  
Abstract: An accurate simulation of a heating coil is used to compare the performance of a PI controller, a neural network trained to predict the steady-state output of the PI controller, a neural network trained to minimize the n-step ahead error between the coil output and the set point, and a reinforcement learning agent trained to minimize the sum of the squared error over time. Although the PI controller works very well for this task, the neural networks do result in improved performance. ",0
"Title: Convergence controls for MCMC algorithms, with applications to hidden Markov chains  
Abstract: In complex models like hidden Markov chains, the convergence of the MCMC algorithms used to approximate the posterior distribution and the Bayes estimates of the parameters of interest must be controlled in a robust manner. We propose in this paper a series of on-line controls, which rely on classical non-parametric tests, to evaluate independence from the start-up distribution, stability of the Markov chain, and asymptotic normality. These tests lead to graphical control spreadsheets which are presented in the set-up of normal mixture hidden Markov chains to compare the full Gibbs sampler with an aggregated Gibbs sampler based on the forward-backward formulae. ","Title: Issues in the Integration of Data Mining and Data Visualization Visualizing the Simple Bayesian Classifier  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC), sometimes called Naive-Bayes, is built based on a conditional independence model of each attribute given the class. The model was previously shown to be surprisingly robust to obvious violations of this independence assumption, yielding accurate classification models even when there are clear conditional dependencies. The SBC can serve as an excellent tool for initial exploratory data analysis when coupled with a visualizer that makes its structure comprehensible. We describe such a visual representation of the SBC model that has been successfully implemented. We describe the requirements we had for such a visualization and the design decisions we made to satisfy them. ",0
"Title: A self-organizing multiple-view representation of 3D objects  
Abstract: We explore representation of 3D objects in which several distinct 2D views are stored for each object. We demonstrate the ability of a two-layer network of thresholded summation units to support such representations. Using unsupervised Hebbian relaxation, the network learned to recognize ten objects from different viewpoints. The training process led to the emergence of compact representations of the specific input views. When tested on novel views of the same objects, the network exhibited a substantial generalization capability. In simulated psychophysical experiments, the network's behavior was qualitatively similar to that of human subjects. ","Title: Prediction of human mRNA donor and acceptor sites from the DNA sequence  
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been applied to the prediction of splice site location in human pre-mRNA. A joint prediction scheme where prediction of transition regions between introns and exons regulates a cutoff level for splice site assignment was able to predict splice site locations with confidence levels far better than previously reported in the literature. The problem of predicting donor and acceptor sites in human genes is hampered by the presence of numerous amounts of false positives | in the paper the distribution of these false splice sites is examined and linked to a possible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. When the presented method detects 95% of the true donor and acceptor sites it makes less than 0.1% false donor site assignments and less than 0.4% false acceptor site assignments. For the large data set used in this study this means that on the average there are one and a half false donor sites per true donor site and six false acceptor sites per true acceptor site. With the joint assignment method more than a fifth of the true donor sites and around one fourth of the true acceptor sites could be detected without accompaniment of any false positive predictions. Highly confident splice sites could not be isolated with a widely used weight matrix method or by separate splice site networks. A complementary relation between the confidence levels of the coding/non-coding and the separate splice site networks was observed, with many weak splice sites having sharp transitions in the coding/non-coding signal and many stronger splice sites having more ill-defined transitions between coding and non-coding.

"Title: Computing Nonparametric Hierarchical Models  
Abstract: Bayesian models involving Dirichlet process mixtures are at the heart of the modern nonparametric Bayesian movement. Much of the rapid development of these models in the last decade has been a direct result of advances in simulation-based computational methods. Some of the very early work in this area, circa 1988-1991, focused on the use of such nonparametric ideas and models in applications of otherwise standard hierarchical models. This chapter provides some historical review and perspective on these developments, with a prime focus on the use and integration of such nonparametric ideas in hierarchical models. We illustrate the ease with which the strict parametric assumptions common to most standard Bayesian hierarchical models can be relaxed to incorporate uncertainties about functional forms using Dirichlet process components, partly enabled by the approach to computation using MCMC methods. The resulting methology is illustrated with two examples taken from an unpublished 1992 report on the topic.","Title: Using a Genetic Algorithm to Learn Strategies for Collision Avoidance and Local Navigation  
Abstract: Navigation through obstacles such as mine fields is an important capability for autonomous underwater vehicles. One way to produce robust behavior is to perform projective planning. However, real-time performance is a critical requirement in navigation. What is needed for a truly autonomous vehicle are robust reactive rules that perform well in a wide variety of situations, and that also achieve real-time performance. In this work, SAMUEL, a learning system based on genetic algorithms, is used to learn high-performance reactive strategies for navigation and collision avoidance. ",0
"Title: MDL Learning of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Discrete Problem Domains  
Abstract: Given a problem, a case-based reasoning (CBR) system will search its case memory and use the stored cases to find the solution, possibly modifying retrieved cases to adapt to the required input specifications. In discrete domains CBR reasoning can be based on a rigorous Bayesian probability propagation algorithm. Such a Bayesian CBR system can be implemented as a probabilistic feedforward neural network with one of the layers representing the cases. In this paper we introduce a Minimum Description Length (MDL) based learning algorithm to obtain the proper network structure with the associated conditional probabilities. This algorithm together with the resulting neural network implementation provide a massively parallel architecture for solving the efficiency bottleneck in case-based reasoning. ","Title: Differential theory of learning for efficient neural network pattern recognition  
Abstract: We describe a new theory of differential learning by which a broad family of pattern classifiers (including many well-known neural network paradigms) can learn stochastic concepts efficiently. We describe the relationship between a classifier's ability to generalize well to unseen test examples and the efficiency of the strategy by which it learns. We list a series of proofs that differential learning is efficient in its information and computational resource requirements, whereas traditional probabilistic learning strategies are not. The proofs are illustrated by a simple example that lends itself to closed-form analysis. We conclude with an optical character recognition task for which three different types of differentially generated classifiers generalize significantly better than their probabilistically generated counterparts.

"Title: Independent Component Analysis by General Non-linear Hebbian-like Learning Rules  
Abstract: A number of neural learning rules have been recently proposed for Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The rules are usually derived from information-theoretic criteria such as maximum entropy or minimum mutual information. In this paper, we show that in fact, ICA can be performed by very simple Hebbian or anti-Hebbian learning rules, which may have only weak relations to such information-theoretical quantities. Rather suprisingly, practically any non-linear function can be used in the learning rule, provided only that the sign of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian term is chosen correctly. In addition to the Hebbian-like mechanism, the weight vector is here constrained to have unit norm, and the data is preprocessed by prewhitening, or sphering. These results imply that one can choose the non-linearity so as to optimize desired statistical or numerical criteria.","Title: Putting the Genetics back into Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate genetic algorithms where more than two parents are involved in the recombination operation. In particular, we introduce gene scanning as a reproduction mechanism that generalizes classical crossovers, such as n-point crossover or uniform crossover, and is applicable to an arbitrary number (two or more) of parents. We performed extensive tests for optimizing numerical functions, the TSP and graph coloring to observe the effect of different numbers of parents. The experiments show that 2-parent recombination is outperformed when using more parents on the classical DeJong functions. For the other problems the results are not conclusive, in some cases 2 parents are optimal, while in some others more parents are better. ",0
"Title: Signal Separation by Nonlinear Hebbian Learning  
Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formalism each employs to handle uncertainty may not be uniform. In order to be able to combine these knowledge bases of different formats, we need to first establish a common basis for characterizing and evaluating the different formalisms, and provide a semantics for the combined mechanism. A common framework can provide an infrastructure for building an integrated system, and is essential if we are to understand its behavior. We present a unifying framework based on an ordered partition of possible worlds called partition sequences, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of biasing towards certain possible scenarios when we are uncertain of the actual situation. We show that some of the existing formalisms, namely, default logic, autoepistemic logic, probabilistic conditioning and thresholding (generalized conditioning), and possibility theory can be incorporated into this general framework.","Title: Induction of One-Level Decision Trees  
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress on the worst-case analysis of inductive learning tasks, but for theoretical results to have impact on practice, they must deal with the average case. In this paper we present an average-case analysis of a simple algorithm that induces one-level decision trees for concepts defined by a single relevant attribute. Given knowledge about the number of training instances, the number of irrelevant attributes, the amount of class and attribute noise, and the class and attribute distributions, we derive the expected classification accuracy over the entire instance space. We then examine the predictions of this analysis for different settings of these domain parameters, comparing them to exper imental results to check our reasoning. ",0
"Title: Induction of decision trees and Bayesian classification applied to diagnosis of sport injuries  
Abstract: Machine learning techniques can be used to extract knowledge from data stored in medical databases. In our application, various machine learning algorithms were used to extract diagnostic knowledge to support the diagnosis of sport injuries. The applied methods include variants of the Assistant algorithm for top-down induction of decision trees, and variants of the Bayesian classifier. The available dataset was insufficent for reliable diagnosis of all sport injuries considered by the system. Consequently, expert-defined diagnostic rules were added and used as pre-classifiers or as generators of additional training instances for injuries with few training examples. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy and the explanation capability of the naive Bayesian classifier with the fuzzy discretization of numerical attributes was superior to other methods and was estimated as the most appro priate for practical use.","Title: Geometric Ergodicity of Gibbs and Block Gibbs Samplers for a Hierarchical Random Effects Model

"Title: Explaining Anomalies as a Basis for Knowledge Base Refinement  
Abstract: Explanations play a key role in operationalization-based anomaly detection techniques. In this paper we show that their role is not limited to anomaly detection; they can also be used for guiding automated knowledge base refinement. We introduce a refinement procedure which takes: (i) a small number of refinement rules (rather than test cases), and (ii) explanations constructed in an attempt to reveal the cause (or causes) for inconsistencies detected during the verification process, and returns rule revisions aiming to recover the consistency of the KB-theory. Inconsistencies caused by more than one anomaly are handled at the same time, which improves the efficiency of the refinement process.

Abstract: Our experience showed us that exibility in expressing a parallel algorithm for simulating neural networks is desirable even if it is not possible then to obtain the most efficient solution for any single training algorithm. We believe that the advantages of a clear and easy to understand program predominates the disadvantages of approaches allowing only for a specific machine or neural network algorithm. We currently investigate if other neural network models are worth while being parallelized, and how the resulting parallel algorithms can be composed of a few common basic building blocks and the logarithmic tree as efficient communication structure. 1 2 4 8 2 500 connections 40 000 connections [1] D.

"Title: Exploratory Modelling of Multiple Non-Stationary Time Series: Latent Process Structure and Decompositions  
Abstract: We describe and illustrate Bayesian approaches to modelling and analysis of multiple non-stationary time series. This begins with uni-variate models for collections of related time series assumedly driven by underlying but unobservable processes, referred to as dynamic latent factor processes. We focus on models in which the factor processes, and hence the observed time series, are modelled by time-varying autoregressions capable of flexibly representing ranges of observed non-stationary characteristics. We highlight concepts and new methods of time series decomposition to infer characteristics of latent components in time series, and relate uni-variate decomposition analyses to underlying multivariate dynamic factor structure. Our motivating application is in analysis of multiple EEG traces from an ongoing EEG study at Duke. In this study, individuals undergoing ECT therapy generate multiple EEG traces at various scalp locations, and physiological interest lies in identifying dependencies and dissimilarities across series. In addition to the multivariate and non-stationary aspects of the series, this area provides illustration of the new results about decomposition of time series into latent, physically interpretable components; this is illustrated in data analysis of one EEG data set. The paper also discusses current and future research directions. fl This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant DMS-9311071. The EEG data and context arose from discussions with Dr Andrew Krystal, of Duke University Medical Center, with whom continued interactions have been most valuable.

Semi-global stability results are obtained under the key assumption that the system uncertainty satisfies a ""matching"" condition. The localization properties of adaptive networks are discussed and formal definitions of interference and localization measures are proposed. ",0
"Title: Cortical Mechanisms of Visual Recognition and Learning: A Hierarchical Kalman Filter Model  
Abstract: We describe a biologically plausible model of dynamic recognition and learning in the visual cortex based on the statistical theory of Kalman filtering from optimal control theory. The model utilizes a hierarchical network whose successive levels implement Kalman filters operating over successively larger spatial and temporal scales. Each hierarchical level in the network predicts the current visual recognition state at a lower level and adapts its own recognition state using the residual error between the prediction and the actual lower-level state. Simultaneously, the network also learns an internal model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input stream by adapting the synaptic weights at each hierarchical level in order to minimize prediction errors. The Kalman filter model respects key neuroanatomical data such as the reciprocity of connections between visual cortical areas, and assigns specific computational roles to the inter-laminar connections known to exist between neurons in the visual cortex. Previous work elucidated the usefulness of this model in explaining neurophysiological phenomena such as endstopping and other related extra-classical receptive field effects. In this paper, in addition to providing a more detailed exposition of the model, we present a variety of experimental results demonstrating the ability of this model to perform robust spatiotemporal segmentation and recognition of objects and image sequences in the presence of varying amounts of occlusion, background clutter, and noise. ","Title: Distance Induction in First Order Logic used for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. Experiments on
Abstract: This paper tackles the supervised induction of a distance from examples described as Horn clauses or constrained clauses. In opposition to syntax-driven approaches, this approach is discrimination-driven: it proceeds by defining a small set of complex discriminant hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as new concepts, used to redescribe the initial examples. Further, this redescription can be embedded into the space of natural integers, and a distance between examples thus naturally follows. ",0
"Title: Causality in Genetic Programming  
Abstract: Causality relates changes in the structure of an object with the effects of such changes, that is changes in the properties or behavior of the object. This paper analyzes the concept of causality in Genetic Programming (GP) and suggests how it can be used in adapting control parameters for speeding up GP search. We first analyze the effects of crossover to show the weak causality of the GP representation and operators. Hierarchical GP approaches based on the discovery and evolution of functions amplify this phenomenon. However, selection gradually retains strongly causal changes. Causality is correlated to search space exploitation and is discussed in the context of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The results described argue for a bottom-up GP evolutionary thesis. Finally, new developments based on the idea of GP architecture evolution (Koza, 1994a) are discussed from the causality perspective. ","Title: As mentioned in the introduction, an encod-ing/crossover pair makes a spectrum of geographical linkages. A
Abstract: It is open as to which chromosomal dimension performs best. Although higher-dimensional encodings (whether real or imaginary) can preserve more geographical gene linkages, we suspect that too high a dimension would not perform desirably. We are studying the question of which dimension of encoding is best for a given instance. It is likely that the optimal dimension is somehow dependent on the chromosome size and the input graph topology; interactions with the flexibility of crossover are yet unknown. The interaction of these considerations with the number of cuts used in the crossover is also an open issue. * In relocating genes onto a multi-dimensional chromosome, the simplest way is via a sequential assignment such as row-major order. Section 4 showed that performance improves when a DFS-row-major reembedding is used for two- and three-dimensional encodings. We suspect that this phenomenon will be consistent for higher-dimensional cases, and hope to perform more detailed investigations in the future. Although DFS reordering proved to be helpful for both linear encodings [19] and multi-dimensional encodings, we do not believe DFS-row-major reembedding is a good approach for the multi-dimensional cases since the row-major embedding is so simplistic. We are considering alternative 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional reembeddings which will hopefully provide further improvement. [4] T. N. Bui and B. R. Moon.

"Title: Knowledge Discovery in International Conflict Databases  
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is heavily supported by military institutions, while practically no effort goes into the investigation of possible contributions of AI to the avoidance and termination of crises and wars. This paper makes a first step into this direction by investigating the use of machine learning techniques for discovering knowledge in international conflict and conflict management databases. We have applied similarity-based case retrieval to the KOSIMO database of international conflicts. Furthermore, we present results of analyzing the CONFMAN database of successful and unsuccessful conflict management attempts with an inductive decision tree learning algorithm. The latter approach seems to be particularly promising, as conflict management events apparently are more repetitive and thus better suited for machine-aided analysis. ","Title: SUPERVISED COMPETITIVE LEARNING FOR FINDING POSITIONS OF RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS  
Abstract: This paper introduces the magnetic neural gas (MNG) algorithm, which extends unsupervised competitive learning with class information to improve the positioning of radial basis functions. The basic idea of MNG is to discover heterogeneous clusters (i.e., clusters with data from different classes) and to migrate additional neurons towards them. The discovery is effected by a heterogeneity coefficient associated with each neuron and the migration is guided by introducing a kind of magnetic effect. The performance of MNG is tested on a number of data sets, including the thyroid data set. Results demonstrate promise. ",0
"Title: Learning Markov chains with variable memory length from noisy output  
Abstract: The problem of modeling complicated data sequences, such as DNA or speech, often arises in practice. Most of the algorithms select a hypothesis from within a model class assuming that the observed sequence is the direct output of the underlying generation process. In this paper we consider the case when the output passes through a memoryless noisy channel before observation. In particular, we show that in the class of Markov chains with variable memory length, learning is affected by factors, which, despite being super-polynomial, are still small in some practical cases. Markov models with variable memory length, or probabilistic finite suffix automata, were introduced in learning theory by Ron, Singer and Tishby who also described a polynomial time learning algorithm [11, 12]. We present a modification of the algorithm which uses a noise-corrupted sample and has knowledge of the noise structure. The same algorithm is still viable if the noise is not known exactly but a good estimation is available. Finally, some experimental results are presented for removing noise from corrupted English text, and to measure how the performance of the learning algorithm is affected by the size of the noisy sample and the noise rate. ","Title: Learning by Refining Algorithm Sketches  
Abstract: In this paper we suggest a mechanism that improves significantly the performance of a top-down inductive logic programming (ILP) learning system. This improvement is achieved at the cost of giving to the system extra information that is not difficult to formulate. This information appears in the form of an algorithm sketch: an incomplete and somewhat vague representation of the computation related to a particular example. We describe which sketches are admissible, give details of the learning algorithm that exploits the information contained in the sketch. The experiments carried out with the implemented system (SKIL) have demonstrated the usefulness of the method and its potential in future applications. ",0
"Title: Applying ILP to Diterpene Structure Elucidation from 13 C NMR Spectra  
Abstract: We present a novel application of ILP to the problem of diterpene structure elucidation from 13 C NMR spectra. Diterpenes are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effectors. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based on 13 C NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom number that corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for solving combinatorial optimization problems through the application of reinforcement learning methods. The approach can be applied in cases where several similar instances of a combinatorial optimization problem must be solved. The key idea is to analyze a set of ""training"" problem instances and learn a search control policy for solving new problem instances. The search control policy has the twin goals of finding high-quality solutions and finding them quickly. Results of applying this methodology to a NASA scheduling problem show that the learned search control policy is much more effective than the best known non-learning search procedure|a method based on simulated annealing.",0
"Title: Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Temperature Using Smoothing Spline ANOVA  
Abstract: In tasks requiring sustained attention, human alertness varies on a minute time scale. This can have serious consequences in occupations ranging from air traffic control to monitoring of nuclear power plants. Changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum accompany these fluctuations in the level of alertness, as assessed by measuring simultaneous changes in EEG and performance on an auditory monitoring task. By combining power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis and artificial neural networks, we show that continuous, accurate, noninvasive, and near real-time estimation of an operator's global level of alertness is feasible using EEG measures recorded from as few as two central scalp sites. This demonstration could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings. ","Title: Symbiotic Evolution of Neural Networks in Sequential Decision Tasks  
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC), sometimes called Naive-Bayes, is built based on a conditional independence model of each attribute given the class. The model was previously shown to be surprisingly robust to obvious violations of this independence assumption, yielding accurate classification models even when there are clear conditional dependencies. The SBC can serve as an excellent tool for initial exploratory data analysis when coupled with a visualizer that makes its structure comprehensible. We describe such a visual representation of the SBC model that has been successfully implemented. We describe the requirements we had for such a visualization and the design decisions we made to satisfy them. ",0

The local linear algorithm is also more than an order of magnitude faster to train.","Title: NETWORKS, FUNCTION DETERMINES FORM

"Title: Bayesian Induction of Features in Temporal Domains  
Abstract: Most concept induction algorithms process concept instances described in terms of properties that remain constant over time. In temporal domains, instances are best described in terms of properties whose values vary with time. Data engineering is called upon in temporal domains to transform the raw data into an appropriate form for concept induction. I investigate a method for inducing features suitable for classifying finite, univariate, time series that are governed by unknown deterministic processes contaminated by noise. In a supervised setting, I induce piecewise polynomials of appropriate complexity to characterize the data in each class, using Bayesian model induction principles. In this study, I evaluate the proposed method empirically in a semi-deterministic domain: the waveform classification problem, originally presented in the CART book. I compared the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm to the accuracy attained by C4.5 under various noise levels. Feature induction improved the classification accuracy in noisy situations, but degraded it when there was no noise. The results demonstrate the value of the proposed method in the presence of noise, and reveal a weakness shared by all classifiers using generative rather than discriminative models: sensitivity to model inaccuracies.

"Title: Learning a Specialization for Face Recognition: The Effect of Spatial Frequency  
Abstract: The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent mechanisms in the brain. Such a dissociation could be the result of a competitive learning mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Studies of normal adult performance on face and object recognition tasks seem to indicate that face recognition is primarily configural, involving the low spatial frequency information present in a stimulus over relatively large distances, whereas object recognition is primarily featural, involving analysis of the object's parts using local, high spatial frequency information. In a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, two modules compete to classify input stimuli; when one module receives low spatial frequency information and the other receives high spatial frequency information, the low-frequency module shows a strong specialization for face recognition in a combined face identification/object classification task. The series of experiments shows that the fine discrimination necessary for distinguishing members of a visually homoge neous class such as faces relies heavily on the low spatial frequencies present in a stimulus.","Title: Trading Spaces: Computation, Representation and the Limits of Uninformed Learning

"Title: Pointer Adaptation and Pruning of Min-Max Fuzzy Inference and Estimation  
Abstract: This paper describes a partial-memory incremental learning method based on the AQ15c inductive learning system. The method maintains a representative set of past training examples that are used together with new examples to appropriately modify the currently held hypotheses. Incremental learning is evoked by feedback from the environment or from the user. Such a method is useful in applications involving intelligent agents acting in a changing environment, active vision, and dynamic knowledge-bases. For this study, the method is applied to the problem of computer intrusion detection in which symbolic profiles are learned for a computer systems users. In the experiments, the proposed method yielded significant gains in terms of learning time and memory requirements at the expense of slightly lower predictive accuracy and higher concept complexity, when compared to batch learning, in which all examples are given at once.

"Title: Space-Frequency Localized Basis Function Networks for Nonlinear System Estimation and Control  
Abstract: Stable neural network control and estimation may be viewed formally as a merging of concepts from nonlinear dynamic systems theory with tools from multivariate approximation theory. This paper extends earlier results on adaptive control and estimation of nonlinear systems using gaussian radial basis functions to the on-line generation of irregularly sampled networks, using tools from multiresolution analysis and wavelet theory. This yields much more compact and efficient system representations while preserving global closed-loop stability. Approximation models employing basis functions that are localized in both space and spatial frequency admit a measure of the approximated function's spatial frequency content that is not directly dependent on reconstruction error. As a result, these models afford a means of adaptively selecting basis functions according to the local spatial frequency content of the approximated function. An algorithm for stable, on-line adaptation of output weights simultaneously with node configuration in a class of non-parametric models with wavelet basis functions is presented. An asymptotic bound on the error in the network's reconstruction is derived and shown to be dependent solely on the minimum approximation error associated with the steady state node configuration. In addition, prior bounds on the temporal bandwidth of the system to be identified or controlled are used to develop a criterion for on-line selection of radial and ridge wavelet basis functions, thus reducing the rate of increase in network's size with the dimension of the state vector. Experimental results obtained by using the network to predict the path of an unknown light bluff object thrown through air, in an active-vision based robotic catching system, are given to illustrate the network's performance in a simple real-time application. ","Title: The Troubling Aspects of a Building Block Hypothesis for Genetic Programming  
Abstract: In this paper we carefully formulate a Schema Theorem for Genetic Programming (GP) using a schema definition that accounts for the variable length and the non-homologous nature of GP's representation. In a manner similar to early GA research, we use interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP Building Block definition and to state a ""classical"" Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by hierarchically combining building blocks. We report that this approach is not convincing for several reasons: it is difficult to find support for the promotion and combination of building blocks solely by rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically questionable whether building blocks always exist because partial solutions of consistently above average fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured; also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account of GP search behavior.",0
"Title: Mistake-Driven Learning in Text Categorization  
Abstract: Learning problems in the text processing domain often map the text to a space whose dimensions are the measured features of the text, e.g., its words. Three characteristic properties of this domain are (a) very high dimensionality, (b) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space, and (c) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance. In this work we study three mistake-driven learning algorithms for a typical task of this nature - text categorization. We argue that these algorithms which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the feature space have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain. We then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the domain. In particular, we demonstrate (1) how variation in document length can be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative weights, (2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training, (3) alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of discarding features while training. Overall, we present an algorithm, a variation of Littlestone's Winnow, which performs significantly better than any other algorithm tested on this task using a similar feature set. ","Title: A utility-based approach to learning in a mixed Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning architecture  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used as a form of ""caching"" solved problems to speedup later problem solving. Using ""cached"" cases brings additional costs with it due to retrieval time, case adaptation time and also storage space. Simply storing all cases will result in a situation in which retrieving and trying to adapt old cases will take more time (on average) than not caching at all. This means that caching must be applied selectively to build a case memory that is actually useful. This is a form of the utility problem [4, 2]. The approach taken here is to construct a ""cost model"" of a system that can be used to predict the effect of changes to the system. In this paper we describe the utility problem associated with ""caching"" cases and the construction of a ""cost model"". We present experimental results that demonstrate that the model can be used to predict the effect of certain changes to the case memory.",0

"Title: Function Approximation with Neural Networks and Local Methods: Bias, Variance and Smoothness  
Abstract: We review the use of global and local methods for estimating a function mapping R m ) R n from samples of the function containing noise. The relationship between the methods is examined and an empirical comparison is performed using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) global neural network model, the single nearest-neighbour model, a linear local approximation (LA) model, and the following commonly used datasets: the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, the Sunspot time series, British English Vowel data, TIMIT speech phonemes, building energy prediction data, and the sonar dataset. We find that the simple local approximation models often outperform the MLP. No criterion such as classification/prediction, size of the training set, dimensionality of the training set, etc. can be used to distinguish whether the MLP or the local approximation method will be superior. However, we find that if we consider histograms of the k-NN density estimates for the training datasets then we can choose the best performing method a priori by selecting local approximation when the spread of the density histogram is large and choosing the MLP otherwise. This result correlates with the hypothesis that the global MLP model is less appropriate when the characteristics of the function to be approximated varies throughout the input space. We discuss the results, the smoothness assumption often made in function approximation, and the bias/variance dilemma. ","Title: The Complexity of Theory Revision  
Abstract: A knowledge-based system uses its database (a.k.a. its ""theory"") to produce answers to the queries it receives. Unfortunately, these answers may be incorrect if the underlying theory is faulty. Standard ""theory revision"" systems use a given set of ""labeled queries"" (each a query paired with its correct answer) to transform the given theory, by adding and/or deleting either rules and/or antecedents, into a related theory that is as accurate as possible. After formally defining the theory revision task and bounding its sample complexity, this paper addresses the task's computational complexity. It first proves that, unless P = N P , no polynomial time algorithm can identify the optimal theory, even given the exact distribution of queries, except in the most trivial of situations. It also shows that, except in such trivial situations, no polynomial-time algorithm can produce a theory whose inaccuracy is even close (i.e., within a particular polynomial factor) to optimal. These results justify the standard practice of hill-climbing to a locally-optimal theory, based on a given set of labeled sam ples.",0
"Title: Induction of Oblique Decision Trees  
Abstract: This paper introduces a randomized technique for partitioning examples using oblique hyperplanes. Standard decision tree techniques, such as ID3 and its descendants, partition a set of points with axis-parallel hyper-planes. Our method, by contrast, attempts to find hyperplanes at any orientation. The purpose of this more general technique is to find smaller but equally accurate decision trees than those created by other methods. We have tested our algorithm on both real and simulated data, and found that in some cases it produces surprisingly small trees without losing predictive accuracy. Small trees allow us, in turn, to obtain simple qualitative descriptions of each problem domain.","Title: Genetic Programming Exploratory Power and the Discovery of Functions  
Abstract: Hierarchical genetic programming (HGP) approaches rely on the discovery, modification, and use of new functions to accelerate evolution. This paper provides a qualitative explanation of the improved behavior of HGP, based on an analysis of the evolution process from the dual perspective of diversity and causality. From a static point of view, the use of an HGP approach enables the manipulation of a population of higher diversity programs. Higher diversity increases the exploratory ability of the genetic search process, as demonstrated by theoretical and experimental fitness distributions and expanded structural complexity of individuals. From a dynamic point of view, an analysis of the causality of the crossover operator suggests that HGP discovers and exploits useful structures in a bottom-up, hierarchical manner. Diversity and causality are complementary, affecting exploration and exploitation in genetic search. Unlike other machine learning techniques that need extra machinery to control the tradeoff between them, HGP automatically trades off exploration and exploitation. ",0
"Title: A Bootstrap Evaluation of the Effect of Data Splitting on Financial Time Series  
Abstract: This article exposes problems of the commonly used technique of splitting the available data into training, validation, and test sets that are held fixed, warns about drawing too strong conclusions from such static splits, and shows potential pitfalls of ignoring variability across splits. Using a bootstrap or resampling method, we compare the uncertainty in the solution stemming from the data splitting with neural network specific uncertainties (parameter initialization, choice of number of hidden units, etc.). We present two results on data from the New York Stock Exchange. First, the variation due to different resamplings is significantly larger than the variation due to different network conditions. This result implies that it is important to not over-interpret a model (or an ensemble of models) estimated on one specific split of the data. Second, on each split, the neural network solution with early stopping is very close to a linear model; no significant nonlinearities are extracted. ","Title: Comparing Predictive Inference Methods for Discrete Domains  
Abstract: Predictive inference is seen here as the process of determining the predictive distribution of a discrete variable, given a data set of training examples and the values for the other problem domain variables. We consider three approaches for computing this predictive distribution, and assume that the joint probability distribution for the variables belongs to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric models. In the simplest case, the predictive distribution is computed by using the model with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) posterior probability. In the evidence approach, the predictive distribution is obtained by averaging over all the individual models in the model family. In the third case, we define the predictive distribution by using Rissanen's new definition of stochastic complexity. Our experiments performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that when using all the data available, the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions in the log-score sense. However, when the amount of available training data is decreased, the evidence approach clearly outperforms the two other approaches. The MAP predictive distribution is clearly inferior in the log-score sense to the two more sophisticated approaches, but for the 0/1-score the MAP approach may still in some cases produce the best results.

"Title: A Comparison of Random Search versus Genetic Programming as Engines for Collective Adaptation  
Abstract: We have integrated the distributed search of genetic programming (GP) based systems with collective memory to form a collective adaptation search method. Such a system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. Since the pure GP approach does not scale well with problem complexity, a natural question is which of the two components is actually contributing to the search process. We investigate a collective memory search which utilizes a random search engine and find that it significantly outperforms the GP based search engine.

Thereafter a new method, Incremental Reduced Error Pruning, is proposed that attempts to address all of these problems. Experiments show that in many noisy domains this method is much more efficient than alternative algorithms, along with a slight gain in accuracy. However, the experiments show as well that the use of this algorithm cannot be recommended for domains with a very specific concept description. ",0
"Title: Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights  
Abstract: Supervised neural networks generalize well if there is much less information in the weights than there is in the output vectors of the training cases. So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-off between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed efficiently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights.","Title: d d Techniques for Extracting Instruction Level Parallelism on MIMD Architectures  
Abstract: Extensive research has been done on extracting parallelism from single instruction stream processors. This paper presents some results of our investigation into ways to modify MIMD architectures to allow them to extract the instruction level parallelism achieved by current superscalar and VLIW machines. A new architecture is proposed which utilizes the advantages of a multiple instruction stream design while addressing some of the limitations that have prevented MIMD architectures from performing ILP operation. A new code scheduling mechanism is described to support this new architecture by partitioning instructions across multiple processing elements in order to exploit this level of parallelism. ",0
"Title: The optimal number of learning samples and hidden units in function approximation with a feedforward network  
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to estimate the optimal number of learning samples and the number of hidden units needed to obtain a desired accuracy of a function approximation by a feedforward network. The representation error and the generalization error, components of the total approximation error are analyzed and the approximation accuracy of a feedforward network is investigated as a function of the number of hidden units and the number of learning samples. Based on the asymptotical behavior of the approximation error, an asymptotical model of the error function (AMEF) is introduced of which the parameters can be determined experimentally. An alternative model of the error function, which include theoretical results about general bounds of approximation, is also analyzed. In combination with knowledge about the computational complexity of the learning rule an optimal learning set size and number of hidden units can be found resulting in a minimum computation time for a given desired precision of the approximation. This approach was applied to optimize the learning of the camera-robot mapping of a visually guided robot arm and a complex logarithm function approximation.

"Title: Learning Markov chains with variable memory length from noisy output  
Abstract: The problem of modeling complicated data sequences, such as DNA or speech, often arises in practice. Most of the algorithms select a hypothesis from within a model class assuming that the observed sequence is the direct output of the underlying generation process. In this paper we consider the case when the output passes through a memoryless noisy channel before observation. In particular, we show that in the class of Markov chains with variable memory length, learning is affected by factors, which, despite being super-polynomial, are still small in some practical cases. Markov models with variable memory length, or probabilistic finite suffix automata, were introduced in learning theory by Ron, Singer and Tishby who also described a polynomial time learning algorithm [11, 12]. We present a modification of the algorithm which uses a noise-corrupted sample and has knowledge of the noise structure. The same algorithm is still viable if the noise is not known exactly but a good estimation is available. Finally, some experimental results are presented for removing noise from corrupted English text, and to measure how the performance of the learning algorithm is affected by the size of the noisy sample and the noise rate.

Abstract: resent allowed sequences of resolution steps for the initial theory. There are, however, many characterizations of allowed sequences of resolution steps that cannot be expressed by a set of resolvents. One approach to this problem is presented, the system mer-lin, which is based on an earlier technique for learning finite-state automata that represent allowed sequences of resolution steps. merlin extends the previous technique in three ways: i) negative examples are considered in addition to positive examples, ii) a new strategy for performing generalization is used, and iii) a technique for converting the learned automaton to a logic program is included. Results from experiments are presented in which merlin outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing generalization, and a traditional covering technique. The latter result can be explained by the limited expressiveness of hypotheses produced by covering and also by the fact that covering needs to produce the correct base clauses for a recursive definition before ",0
"Title: Efficient Distribution-free Learning of Probabilistic Concepts  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a new formal model of machine learning in which the concept (boolean function) to be learned may exhibit uncertain or probabilistic behavior|thus, the same input may sometimes be classified as a positive example and sometimes as a negative example. Such probabilistic concepts (or p-concepts) may arise in situations such as weather prediction, where the measured variables and their accuracy are insufficient to determine the outcome with certainty. We adopt from the Valiant model of learning [27] the demands that learning algorithms be efficient and general in the sense that they perform well for a wide class of p-concepts and for any distribution over the domain. In addition to giving many efficient algorithms for learning natural classes of p-concepts, we study and develop in detail an underlying theory of learning p-concepts. ","Title: 25 Learning in Hybrid Noise Environments Using Statistical Queries  
Abstract: We consider formal models of learning from noisy data. Specifically, we focus on learning in the probability approximately correct model as defined by Valiant. Two of the most widely studied models of noise in this setting have been classification noise and malicious errors. However, a more realistic model combining the two types of noise has not been formalized. We define a learning environment based on a natural combination of these two noise models. We first show that hypothesis testing is possible in this model. We next describe a simple technique for learning in this model, and then describe a more powerful technique based on statistical query learning. We show that the noise tolerance of this improved technique is roughly optimal with respect to the desired learning accuracy and that it provides a smooth tradeoff between the tolerable amounts of the two types of noise. Finally, we show that statistical query simulation yields learning algorithms for other combinations of noise models, thus demonstrating that statistical query specification truly An important goal of research in machine learning is to determine which tasks can be automated, and for those which can, to determine their information and computation requirements. One way to answer these questions is through the development and investigation of formal models of machine learning which capture the task of learning under plausible assumptions. In this work, we consider the formal model of learning from examples called ""probably approximately correct"" (PAC) learning as defined by Valiant [Val84]. In this setting, a learner attempts to approximate an unknown target concept simply by viewing positive and negative examples of the concept. An adversary chooses, from some specified function class, a hidden f0; 1g-valued target function defined over some specified domain of examples and chooses a probability distribution over this domain. The goal of the learner is to output in both polynomial time and with high probability, an hypothesis which is ""close"" to the target function with respect to the distribution of examples. The learner gains information about the target function and distribution by interacting with an example oracle. At each request by the learner, this oracle draws an example randomly according to the hidden distribution, labels it according to the hidden target function, and returns the labelled example to the learner. A class of functions F is said to be PAC learnable if captures the generic fault tolerance of a learning algorithm.",0
"Title: MultiPlayer Residual Advantage Learning With General Function Approximation  
Abstract: A new algorithm, advantage learning, is presented that improves on advantage updating by requiring that a single function be learned rather than two. Furthermore, advantage learning requires only a single type of update, the learning update, while advantage updating requires two different types of updates, a learning update and a normilization update. The reinforcement learning system uses the residual form of advantage learning. An application of reinforcement learning to a Markov game is presented. The testbed has continuous states and nonlinear dynamics. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. On each time step , each player chooses one of two possible actions; turn left or turn right, resulting in a 90 degree instantaneous change in the aircraft s heading. Reinforcement is given only when the missile hits the plane or the plane reaches an escape distance from the missile. The advantage function is stored in a single-hidden-layer sigmoidal network. Speed of learning is increased by a new algorithm , Incremental Delta-Delta (IDD), which extends Jacobs (1988) Delta-Delta for use in incremental training, and differs from Suttons Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (1992) in that it does not require the use of a trace and is amenable for use with general function approximation systems. The advantage learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Empirical results gathered using the missile/aircraft testbed validate theory that suggests residual forms of reinforcement learning algorithms converge to a local minimum of the mean squared Bellman residual when using general function approximation systems. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first time an approximate second order method has been used with residual algorithms. Empirical results are presented comparing convergence rates with and without the use of IDD for the reinforcement learning testbed described above and for a supervised learning testbed. The results of these experiments demonstrate IDD increased the rate of convergence and resulted in an order of magnitude lower total asymptotic error than when using backpropagation alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithm, Q2, for optimizing the expected output of a multi-input noisy continuous function. Q2 is designed to need only a few experiments, it avoids strong assumptions on the form of the function, and it is autonomous in that it requires little problem-specific tweaking. Four existing approaches to this problem (response surface methods, numerical optimization, supervised learning, and evolutionary methods) all have inadequacies when the requirement of ""black box"" behavior is combined with the need for few experiments. Q2 uses instance-based determination of a convex region of interest for performing experiments. In conventional instance-based approaches to learning, a neighborhood was defined by proximity to a query point. In contrast, Q2 defines the neighborhood by a new geometric procedure that captures the size and ",0

Abstract: We study layered belief networks of binary random variables in which the conditional probabilities Pr[childjparents] depend monotonically on weighted sums of the parents. For these networks, we give efficient algorithms for computing rigorous bounds on the marginal probabilities of evidence at the output layer. Our methods apply generally to the computation of both upper and lower bounds, as well as to generic transfer function parameterizations of the conditional probability tables (such as sigmoid and noisy-OR). We also prove rates of convergence of the accuracy of our bounds as a function of network size. Our results are derived by applying the theory of large deviations to the weighted sums of parents at each node in the network. Bounds on the marginal probabilities are computed from two contributions: one assuming that these weighted sums fall near their mean values, and the other assuming that they do not. This gives rise to an interesting trade-off between probable explanations of the evidence and improbable deviations from the mean. In networks where each child has N parents, the gap between our upper and lower bounds behaves as a sum of two terms, one of order p In addition to providing such rates of convergence for large networks, our methods also yield efficient algorithms for approximate inference in fixed networks.

"Title: Oblivious Decision Trees, Graphs, and Top-Down Pruning  
Abstract: We describe a supervised learning algorithm, EODG, that uses mutual information to build an oblivious decision tree. The tree is then converted to an Oblivious read-Once Decision Graph (OODG) by merging nodes at the same level of the tree. For domains that are appropriate for both decision trees and OODGs, performance is approximately the same as that of C4.5, but the number of nodes in the OODG is much smaller. The merging phase that converts the oblivious decision tree to an OODG provides a new way of dealing with the replication problem and a new pruning mechanism that works top down starting from the root. The pruning mechanism is well suited for finding symmetries and aids in recovering from splits on irrelevant features that may happen during the tree construction.","Title: Speculative Hedge: Regulating Compile-Time Speculation Against Profile Variations code performance in the presence of execution
Abstract: Path-oriented scheduling methods, such as trace scheduling and hyperblock scheduling, use speculation to extract instruction-level parallelism from control-intensive programs. These methods predict important execution paths in the current scheduling scope using execution profiling or frequency estimation. Aggressive speculation is then applied to the important execution paths, possibly at the cost of degraded performance along other paths. Therefore, the speed of the output code can be sensitive to the compiler's ability to accurately predict the important execution paths. Prior work in this area has utilized the speculative yield function by Fisher, coupled with dependence height, to distribute instruction priority among execution paths in the scheduling scope. While this technique provides more stability of performance by paying attention to the needs of all paths, it does not directly address the problem of mismatch between compile-time prediction and run-time behavior. The work presented in this paper extends the speculative yield and dependence height heuristic to explicitly minimize the penalty suffered by other paths when instructions are speculated along a path. Since the execution time of a path is determined by the number of cycles spent between a path's entrance and exit in the scheduling scope, the heuristic attempts to eliminate unnecessary speculation that delays any path's exit. Such control of speculation makes the performance much less sensitive to the actual path taken at run time. The proposed method has a strong emphasis on achieving minimal delay to all exits. Thus the name, speculative hedge, is used. This paper presents the speculative hedge heuristic, and shows how it controls over-speculation in a superblock/hyperblock scheduler.

"Title: Advantages of Decision Lists and Implicit Negatives in Inductive Logic Programming  
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the capabilities of Foidl, an inductive logic programming (ILP) system whose distinguishing characteristics are the ability to produce first-order decision lists, the use of an output completeness assumption as a substitute for negative examples, and the use of intensional background knowledge. The development of Foidl was originally motivated by the problem of learning to generate the past tense of English verbs; however, this paper demonstrates its superior performance on two different sets of benchmark ILP problems. Tests on the finite element mesh design problem show that Foidl's decision lists enable it to produce generally more accurate results than a range of methods previously applied to this problem. Tests with a selection of list-processing problems from Bratko's introductory Prolog text demonstrate that the combination of implicit negatives and intensionality allow Foidl to learn correct programs from far fewer examples than Foil.","Title: Problem Solving for Redesign  
Abstract: A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign and developed a task-method structure for redesign. In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a more piecemeal fashion. ",0
"Title: Misclassification Minimization  
Abstract: The problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane, attempting to separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls in n-dimensional real space, is formulated as a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). This general LPEC can be converted to an exact penalty problem with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ""counts"" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.","Title: ON-LINE LEARNING OF LINEAR FUNCTIONS

Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem.",0

Abstract: The multiple extension problem arises because a default theory can use different subsets of its defaults to propose different, mutually incompatible, answers to some queries. This paper presents an algorithm that uses a set of observations to learn a credulous version of this default theory that is (essentially) ""optimally accurate"". In more detail, we can associate a given default theory with a set of related credulous theories R = fR i g, where each R i uses its own total ordering of the defaults to determine which single answer to return for each query. Our goal is to select the credulous theory that has the highest ""expected accuracy"", where each R i 's expected accuracy is the probability that the answer it produces to a query will correspond correctly to the world. Unfortunately, a theory's expected accuracy depends on the distribution of queries, which is usually not known. Moreover, the task of identifying the optimal R opt 2 R, even given that distribution information, is intractable. This paper presents a method, OptAcc, that sidesteps these problems by using a set of samples to estimate the unknown distribution, and by hill-climbing to a local optimum. In particular, given any parameters *; ffi &gt; 0, OptAcc produces an R oa 2 R whose expected accuracy is, with probability at least 1 ffi, within * of a local optimum.

Abstract: The Longest common subsequence problem is examined from the point of view of parameterized computational complexity. There are several different ways in which parameters enter the problem, such as the number of sequences to be analyzed, the length of the common subsequence, and the size of the alphabet. Lower bounds on the complexity of this basic problem imply lower bounds on a number of other sequence alignment and consensus problems. At issue in the theory of parameterized complexity is whether a problem which takes input (x; k) can be solved in time f (k) n ff where ff is independent of k (termed fixed-parameter tractability). It can be argued that this is the appropriate asymptotic model of feasible computability for problems for which a small range of parameter values covers important applications | a situation which certainly holds for many problems in biological sequence analysis. Our main results show that: (1) The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) parameterized by the number of sequences to be analyzed is hard for W [t] for all t. (2) The LCS problem problem, parameterized by the length of the common subsequence, belongs to W [P ] and is hard for W [2]. (3) The LCS problem parameterized both by the number of sequences and the length of the common subsequence, is complete for W [1]. All of the above results are obtained for unrestricted alphabet sizes. For alphabets of a fixed size, problems (2) and (3) are fixed-parameter tractable. We conjecture that (1) remains hard. ",0

Abstract: Accurate and fast estimation of probability density functions is crucial for satisfactory computational performance in many scientific problems. When the type of density is known a priori, then the problem becomes statistical estimation of parameters from the observed values. In the non-parametric case, usual estimators make use of kernel functions. If X j ; j = 1; 2; : : : ; n is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with estimated probability density function f n , in the kernel method the computation of the values f n (X 1 ); f n (X 2 ); : : : ; f n (X n ) requires O(n 2 ) operations, since each kernel needs to be evaluated at every X j . We propose a sequence of special weight functions for the non-parametric estimation of f which requires almost linear time: if m is a slowly growing function that increases without bound with n, our method requires only O(m 2 n) arithmetic operations. We derive conditions for convergence under a number of metrics, which turn out to be similar to those required for the convergence of kernel based methods. We also discuss experiments on different distributions and compare the efficiency and the accuracy of our computations with kernel based estimators for various values of n and m. ",0
"Title: Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs  
Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt; 2 values (i.e., k ""classes""). The definition is acquired by studying large collections of training examples of the form hx i ; f(x i )i. Existing approaches to this problem include (a) direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and (c) application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output codes such as those employed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which BCH error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the performance of ID3 on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on an isolated-letter speech-recognition task. These results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.

This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies.",0

","Title: Topography And Ocular Dominance: A Model Exploring Positive Correlations  
Abstract: The map from eye to brain in vertebrates is topographic, i.e. neighbouring points in the eye map to neighbouring points in the brain. In addition, when two eyes innervate the same target structure, the two sets of fibres segregate to form ocular dominance stripes. Experimental evidence from the frog and goldfish suggests that these two phenomena may be subserved by the same mechanisms. We present a computational model that addresses the formation of both topography and ocular dominance. The model is based on a form of competitive learning with subtractive enforcement of a weight normalization rule. Inputs to the model are distributed patterns of activity presented simultaneously in both eyes. An important aspect of this model is that ocular dominance segregation can occur when the two eyes are positively correlated, whereas previous models have tended to assume zero or negative correlations between the eyes. This allows investigation of the dependence of the pattern of stripes on the degree of correlation between the eyes: we find that increasing correlation leads to narrower stripes. Experiments are suggested to test this prediction.",0

It attempts to answer the question ""Should a given machine learning system now in the prototype stage be fielded?"" The model's inputs are the system's confusion matrix, the cash flow matrix for the application, the cost per decision, the one-time cost of deploying the system, and the rate of return on investment. Like Provost and Fawcett's (1997) ROC convex hull method, the present model can be used for decision-making even when its input variables are not known exactly. Despite its simplicity, it has a number of non-trivial consequences. For example, under it the ""no free lunch"" theorems of learning theory no longer apply.

"Title: Development of triadic neural circuits for visual image stabilization under eye movements  
Abstract: Human visual systems maintain a stable internal representation of a scene even though the image on the retina is constantly changing because of eye movements. Such stabilization can theoretically be effected by dynamic shifts in the receptive field (RF) of neurons in the visual system. This paper examines how a neural circuit can learn to generate such shifts. The shifts are controlled by eye position signals and compensate for the movement in the retinal image caused by eye movements. The development of a neural shifter circuit (Olshausen, Anderson, & Van Essen, 1992) is modeled using triadic connections. These connections are gated by signals that indicate the direction of gaze (eye position signals). In simulations, a neural model is exposed to sequences of stimuli paired with appropriate eye position signals. The initially ","Title: Heuristics and Normative Models of Judgment under Uncertainty  
Abstract: Psychological evidence shows that probability theory is not a proper descriptive model of intuitive human judgment. Instead, some heuristics have been proposed as such a descriptive model. This paper argues that probability theory has limi tations even as a normative model. A new normative model of judgment under uncertainty is designed under the assumption that the system's knowledge and resources are insufficient with respect to the questions that the system needs to answer. The proposed heuristics in human reasoning can also be observed in this new model, and can be justified according to the assumption. ",0
"Title: MANIAC: A Next Generation Neurally Based Autonomous Road Follower  
Abstract: The use of artificial neural networks in the domain of autonomous vehicle navigation has produced promising results. ALVINN [Pomerleau, 1991] has shown that a neural system can drive a vehicle reliably and safely on many different types of roads, ranging from paved paths to interstate highways. Even with these impressive results, several areas within the neural paradigm for autonomous road following still need to be addressed. These include transparent navigation between roads of different type, simultaneous use of different sensors, and generalization to road types which the neural system has never seen. The system presented here addresses these issue with a modular neural architecture which uses pre-trained ALVINN networks and a connectionist superstructure to robustly drive on many dif ferent types of roads.","Title: NP-Completeness of Minimum Rule Sets

The proof is then informally extended to cover a broader spectrum of complexity measures and learning algorithms. ",0
"Title: Book Review New Kids on the Block way in the field of connectionist modeling. The
Abstract: Connectionist Models is a collection of forty papers representing a wide variety of research topics in connectionism. The book is distinguished by a single feature: the papers are almost exclusively contributions of graduate students active in the field. The students were selected by a rigorous review process and participated in a two week long summer school devoted to connectionism 2 . As the ambitious editors state in the foreword: These are bold claims and, if true, the reader is presented with an exciting opportunity to sample the frontiers of connectionism. Their words imply two ways to approach the book. The book must be read not just as a random collection of scientific papers, but also as a challenge to evaluate a controversial field. 2 This summer school is actually the third in a series, previous ones being held in 1986 and 1988. The proceedings of the 1988 summer school (which I had the priviledge of participating in) are reviewed by Nigel Goddard in [4]. Continuing the pattern, a fourth school is scheduled to be held in 1993 in Boulder, CO. ","Title: On the Learnability of Discrete Distributions (extended abstract)  
Abstract: We describe a model of iterated belief revision that extends the AGM theory of revision to account for the effect of a revision on the conditional beliefs of an agent. In particular, this model ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Adopting the Ramsey test, minimal conditional revision provides acceptance conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. We show that problem of determining acceptance of any such nested conditional can be reduced to acceptance tests for unnested conditionals. Thus, iterated revision can be accomplished in a virtual manner, using uniterated revision.",0
"Title: The Complexity of Theory Revision  
Abstract: A knowledge-based system uses its database (a.k.a. its ""theory"") to produce answers to the queries it receives. Unfortunately, these answers may be incorrect if the underlying theory is faulty. Standard ""theory revision"" systems use a given set of ""labeled queries"" (each a query paired with its correct answer) to transform the given theory, by adding and/or deleting either rules and/or antecedents, into a related theory that is as accurate as possible. After formally defining the theory revision task and bounding its sample complexity, this paper addresses the task's computational complexity. It first proves that, unless P = N P , no polynomial time algorithm can identify the optimal theory, even given the exact distribution of queries, except in the most trivial of situations. It also shows that, except in such trivial situations, no polynomial-time algorithm can produce a theory whose inaccuracy is even close (i.e., within a particular polynomial factor) to optimal. These results justify the standard practice of hill-climbing to a locally-optimal theory, based on a given set of labeled sam ples.","Title: Two Constructive Methods for Designing Compact Feedforward Networks of Threshold Units

The various experimental results reported for tasks with binary and real inputs indicate that our methods compare favorably with alternative procedures deriving from similar strategies, both in terms of size of the resulting networks and of their generalization properties.

"Title: Theory Refinement on Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: Theory refinement is the task of updating a domain theory in the light of new cases, to be done automatically or with some expert assistance. The problem of theory refinement under uncertainty is reviewed here in the context of Bayesian statistics, a theory of belief revision. The problem is reduced to an incremental learning task as follows: the learning system is initially primed with a partial theory supplied by a domain expert, and thereafter maintains its own internal representation of alternative theories which is able to be interrogated by the domain expert and able to be incrementally refined from data. Algorithms for refinement of Bayesian networks are presented to illustrate what is meant by ""partial theory"", ""alternative theory representation"", etc. The algorithms are an incremental variant of batch learning algorithms from the literature so can work well in batch and incremental mode.","Title: APPROXIMATION IN L p (R d FROM SPACES SPANNED BY THE PERTURBED INTEGER TRANSLATES OF

Abstract: Satisfiability (SAT) refers to the task of finding a truth assignment that makes an arbitrary boolean expression true. This paper compares a simulated annealing algorithm (SASAT) with GSAT (Selman et al., 1992), a greedy algorithm for solving satisfiability problems. GSAT can solve problem instances that are extremely difficult for traditional satisfiability algorithms. Results suggest that SASAT scales up better as the number of variables increases, solving at least as many hard SAT problems with less effort. The paper then presents an ablation study that helps to explain the relative advantage of SASAT over GSAT. Finally, an improvement to the basic SASAT algorithm is examined, based on a random walk suggested by Selman et al. (1993).

"Title: DIFFERENTIALLY GENERATED NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIERS ARE EFFICIENT  
Abstract: Differential learning for statistical pattern classification is described in [5]; it is based on the classification figure-of-merit (CFM) objective function described in [9, 5]. We prove that differential learning is asymptotically efficient, guaranteeing the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class (see below) as the training sample size grows large, while requiring the least classifier complexity necessary for Bayesian (i.e., minimum probability-of-error) discrimination. Moreover, differential learning almost always guarantees the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class for small training sample sizes. ","Title: Testing for Gaussianity and Non Linearity in the sustained portion of musical sounds.  
Abstract: Higher order spectra of a signal contain information about the non Gaussian and non Linear properties of the system that created it. Since the non linearity in musical signal usually originate in the excitation signal while the linear spectral characteristics are attributed to the resonant chambers, we discard the spectral information by looking at the higher order statistical properties of the residual signal, i.e. the estimated input signal obtained by inverse filtering of the sound. In the current paper we show that the skewness and kurtosis values of the residual could be used for characterization of such important sound properties as belonging to families of strings, woodwind and brass instrumental timbres. The skewness parameter is shown to be closely related to the bicoherence function calculated over the original signal and as such it is succinct to an interpretation as statistical test for the signal conforming to a linear non Gaussian model. The above results are compared to the Hinich bispectral tests for Gaussianity and non Linearity of time series and exhibit a similar classification results. Finally, regarding the higher order statistics of a signal as a feature vector, a statistical distance measure for the cumulant space is suggested. ",0

Abstract: Reinforcement learning can be used not only to predict rewards, but also to predict states, i.e. to learn a model of the world's dynamics. Models can be defined at different levels of temporal abstraction. Multi-time models are models that focus on predicting what will happen, rather than when a certain event will take place. Based on multi-time models, we can define abstract actions, which enable planning (presumably in a more efficient way) at various levels of abstraction.","Title: An Improved Model for Spatially Correlated Binary Responses

Using simulated examples, we show that the autologistic model with covariates for sample data improves predictions as compared to the simple logistic regression model and the standard autologistic model (without covariates).

"Title: Toward a unified theory of spatiotemporal processing in the retina  
Abstract: Traditional evolutionary optimization algorithms assume a static evaluation function, according to which solutions are evolved. Incremental evolution is an approach through which a dynamic evaluation function is scaled over time in order to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization. In this paper, we present empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for genetic programming. Using two domains, a two-agent pursuit-evasion game and the Tracker [6] trail-following task, we demonstrate that incremental evolution is most successful when applied near the beginning of an evolutionary run. We also show that incremental evolution can be successful when the intermediate evaluation functions are more difficult than the target evaluation function, as well as when they are easier than the target function.

"Title: Simultaneous Learning of Control Laws and Local Environment Representations for Intelligent Navigation Robots  
Abstract: Two issues of an intelligent navigation robot have been addressed in this work. First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.","Title: Speeding up Genetic Programming: A Parallel BSP implementation the Bulk Synchronous Parallel Pro gramming (BSP)

"Title: Toward Optimal Feature Selection  
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a method for feature subset selection based on Information Theory. Initially, a framework for defining the theoretically optimal, but computation-ally intractable, method for feature subset selection is presented. We show that our goal should be to eliminate a feature if it gives us little or no additional information beyond that subsumed by the remaining features. In particular, this will be the case for both irrelevant and redundant features. We then give an efficient algorithm for feature selection which computes an approximation to the optimal feature selection criterion. The conditions under which the approximate algorithm is successful are examined. Empirical results are given on a number of data sets, showing that the algorithm effectively han dles datasets with large numbers of features.","Title: Culling Teaching -1 Culling and Teaching in Neuro-evolution  
Abstract: The evolving population of neural nets contains information not only in terms of genes, but also in the collection of behaviors of the population members. Such information can be thought of as a kind of culture of the population. Two ways of exploiting that culture are explored in this paper: (1) Culling overlarge litters: Generate a large number of offspring with different crossovers, quickly evaluate them by comparing their performance to the population, and throw away those that appear poor. (2) Teaching: Use backpropagation to train offspring toward the performance of the population. Both techniques result in faster, more effective neuro-evolution, and they can be effectively combined, as is demonstrated on the inverted pendulum problem. Additional methods of cultural exploitation are possible and will be studied in future work. These results suggest that cultural exploitation is a powerful idea that allows leveraging several aspects of the genetic algorithm.",0
"Title: In  Unsmearing Visual Motion: Development of Long-Range Horizontal Intrinsic Connections  
Abstract: Human vision systems integrate information nonlocally, across long spatial ranges. For example, a moving stimulus appears smeared when viewed briefly (30 ms), yet sharp when viewed for a longer exposure (100 ms) (Burr, 1980). This suggests that visual systems combine information along a trajectory that matches the motion of the stimulus. Our self-organizing neural network model shows how developmental exposure to moving stimuli can direct the formation of horizontal trajectory-specific motion integration pathways that unsmear representations of moving stimuli. These results account for Burr's data and can potentially also model other phenomena, such as visual inertia.","Title: Use of Methodological Diversity to Improve Neural Network Generalisation  
Abstract: Littlewood and Miller [1989] present a statistical framework for dealing with coincident failures in multiversion software systems. They develop a theoretical model that holds the promise of high system reliability through the use of multiple, diverse sets of alternative versions. In this paper we adapt their framework to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the diversity observable in multiple populations of neural networks developed using diverse methodologies. We evaluate the generalisation improvements achieved by a range of methodologically diverse network generation processes. We attempt to order the constituent methodological features with respect to their potential for use in the engineering of useful diversity. We also define and explore the use of relative measures of the diversity between version sets as a guide to the potential for exploiting inter-set diversity. ",0
"Title: Pruning Adaptive Boosting ICML-97 Final Draft  
Abstract: The boosting algorithm AdaBoost, developed by Freund and Schapire, has exhibited outstanding performance on several benchmark problems when using C4.5 as the ""weak"" algorithm to be ""boosted."" Like other ensemble learning approaches, AdaBoost constructs a composite hypothesis by voting many individual hypotheses. In practice, the large amount of memory required to store these hypotheses can make ensemble methods hard to deploy in applications. This paper shows that by selecting a subset of the hypotheses, it is possible to obtain nearly the same levels of performance as the entire set. The results also provide some insight into the behavior of AdaBoost.","Title: Gain Adaptation Beats Least Squares?  
Abstract: I present computational results suggesting that gain-adaptation algorithms based in part on connectionist learning methods may improve over least squares and other classical parameter-estimation methods for stochastic time-varying linear systems. The new algorithms are evaluated with respect to classical methods along three dimensions: asymptotic error, computational complexity, and required prior knowledge about the system. The new algorithms are all of the same order of complexity as LMS methods, O(n), where n is the dimensionality of the system, whereas least-squares methods and the Kalman filter are O(n 2 ). The new methods also improve over the Kalman filter in that they do not require a complete statistical model of how the system varies over time. In a simple computational experiment, the new methods are shown to produce asymptotic error levels near that of the optimal Kalman filter and significantly below those of least-squares and LMS methods. The new methods may perform better even than the Kalman filter if there is any error in the filter's model of how the system varies over time. ",0
"Title: On the Computational Utility of Consciousness  
Abstract: We propose a computational framework for understanding and modeling human consciousness. This framework integrates many existing theoretical perspectives, yet is sufficiently concrete to allow simulation experiments. We do not attempt to explain qualia (subjective experience), but instead ask what differences exist within the cognitive information processing system when a person is conscious of mentally-represented information versus when that information is unconscious. The central idea we explore is that the contents of consciousness correspond to temporally persistent states in a network of computational modules. Three simulations are described illustrating that the behavior of persistent states in the models corresponds roughly to the behavior of conscious states people experience when performing similar tasks. Our simulations show that periodic settling to persistent (i.e., conscious) states improves performance by cleaning up inaccuracies and noise, forcing decisions, and helping keep the system on track toward a solution.","Title: Figure 3: Average model size accepted from a ran-dom prefix-closed samples of various size, and
Abstract: that is based on Angluin's L fl algorithm. The algorithm maintains a model consistent with its past examples. When a new counterexample arrives it tries to extend the model in a minimal fashion. We conducted a set of experiments where random automata that represent different strategies were generated, and the algorithm tried to learn them based on prefix-closed samples of their behavior. The algorithm managed to learn very compact models that agree with the samples. The size of the sample had a small effect on the size of the model. The experimental results suggest that for random prefix-closed samples the algorithm behaves well. However, following Angluin's result on the difficulty of learning almost uniform complete samples [ An-gluin, 1978 ] , it is obvious that our algorithm does not solve the complexity issue of inferring a DFA from a general prefix-closed sample.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on solving graph coloring problems with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). After testing different algorithm variants we conclude that the best option is an asexual EA using order-based representation and an adaptation mechanism that periodically changes the fitness function during the evolution. This adaptive EA is general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping GA on a wide range of problem instances with different size, topology and edge density. The results show that the adaptive EA is superior to the Grouping GA and outperforms DSatur on the hardest problem instances. Furthermore, it scales up better with the problem size than the other two algorithms and indicates a linear computational complexity. ",0
"Title: On Step-Size and Bias in Temporal-Difference Learning  
Abstract: We present results for three new algorithms for setting the step-size parameters, ff and , of temporal-difference learning methods such as TD(). The overall task is that of learning to predict the outcome of an unknown Markov chain based on repeated observations of its state trajectories. The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods. We compare our algorithms with conventional Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods have a natural way of setting the step size: for each state s they use a step size of 1=n s , where n s is the number of times state s has been visited. We seek and come close to achieving comparable step-size algorithms for TD(). One new algorithm uses a = 1=n s schedule to achieve the same effect as processing a state backwards with TD(0), but remains completely incremental. Another algorithm uses a at each time equal to the estimated transition probability of the current transition. We present empirical results showing improvement in convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods and conventional TD(). A limitation of our results at present is that they apply only to tasks whose state trajectories do not contain cycles. ","Title: Knowledge Integration and Rule Extraction in Neural Networks Ph.D. Proposal  
Abstract: One kind of prosodic structure that apparently underlies both music and language is meter. Yet detailed measurements of both music and speech show that the nested periodicities that define metrical structure are noisy in some sense. What kind of system could produce or perceive such variable metrical timing? And what would it take to store particular metrical patterns in the long-term memory of the system? We have developed a network of coupled oscillators that both produces and perceives metrical patterns of pulses. In addition, beginning with an initial state with no biases, it learns to prefer 3-beat patterns (like waltzes) over 2-beat patterns. Models of this general class could learn to entrain to musical patterns. And given a way to process speech to extract appropriate pulses, the model should be applicable to metrical structure in speech as well. Is language metrical? Meter refers both to particular sorts of patterns in time and to an abstract description of such patterns, potentially a cognitive representation of them. In both cases there are two or more hierarchical levels at which equally spaced events occur, and the periods characterizing these levels are integral multiples of each other (usually 2 or 3). The hierarchy is implied in standard Western musical notation, where the different levels are indicated by kinds of notes (quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and by bars separating measures. For example, in a basic waltz-time meter, there are individual beats, all with the same spacing, grouped into sets of three with every third one receiving a stronger accent. In such a meter, there is a hierarchy consisting of both a faster periodic cycle (at the beat level) and a slower one (the measure level) that is 1/3 as fast with its onset (or zero phase angle) coinciding with the zero phase angle of every third beat. Metrical systems like this seem to underlie most forms of music around the world and are often said to underlie human speech as well (Jones, 1932; Martin, 1972). However, an awkward difficulty is that the definition employs the notion of an integer since data on both music and speech show clearly that the perfect temporal ratios predicted by such a definition are not observed in performance. In music performance, various kinds of systematic temporal deviations in the timing specified by musical notation are known to ",0

This article provides a tutorial overview of neural networks, focusing on back propagation networks as a method for approximating nonlinear multivariable functions. We explain, from a statistician's vantage point, why neural networks might be attractive and how they compare to other modern regression techniques. KEYWORDS: nonparametric regression; function approximation; backpropagation. 1 Introduction Networks that mimic the way the brain works; computer programs that actually LEARN patterns; forecasting without having to know statistics. These are just some of the many claims and attractions of artificial neural networks. Neural networks (we will henceforth drop the term artificial, unless we need to distinguish them from biological neural networks) seem to be everywhere these days, and at least in their advertising, are able to do all that statistics can do without all the fuss and bother of having to do anything except buy a piece of software.

"Title: Competitive Anti-Hebbian Learning of Invariants  
Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.","Title: Data-defined Problems and Multiversion Neural-net Systems

"Title: FROM METROPOLIS TO DIFFUSIONS: GIBBS STATES AND OPTIMAL SCALING  
Abstract: This paper investigates the behaviour of the random walk Metropolis algorithm in high dimensional problems. Here we concentrate on the case where the components in the target density is a spatially homogeneous Gibbs distribution with finite range. The performance of the algorithm is strongly linked to the presence or absence of phase transition for the Gibbs distribution; the convergence time being approximately linear in dimension for problems where phase transition is not present. Related to this, there is an optimal way to scale the variance of the proposal distribution in order to maximise the speed of convergence of the algorithm. This turns out to involve scaling the variance of the proposal as the reciprocal of dimension (at least in the phase transition free case). Moreover the actual optimal scaling can be characterised in terms of the overall acceptance rate of the algorithm, the maximising value being 0:234, the value as predicted by studies on simpler classes of target density. The results are proved in the framework of a weak convergence result, which shows that the algorithm actually behaves like an infinite dimensional diffusion process in high dimensions. 1.

"Title: Equivariant adaptive source separation  
Abstract: Source separation consists in recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation which implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called EASI (Equivariant Adaptive Separation via Independence). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating: this specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple, parallelizable structure, for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Close form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. This is completed by some numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

"Title: Model selection using measure functions  
Abstract: The concept of measure functions for generalization performance is suggested. This concept provides an alternative way of selecting and evaluating learned models (classifiers). In addition, it makes it possible to state a learning problem as a computational problem. The the known prior (meta-)knowledge about the problem domain is captured in a measure function that, to each possible combination of a training set and a classifier, assigns a value describing how good the classifier is. The computational problem is then to find a classifier maximizing the measure function. We argue that measure functions are of great value for practical applications. Besides of being a tool for model selection, they: (i) force us to make explicit the relevant prior knowledge about the learning problem at hand, (ii) provide a deeper understanding of existing algorithms, and (iii) help us in the construction of problem-specific algorithms. We illustrate the last point by suggesting a novel algorithm based on incremental search for a classifier that optimizes a given measure function.","Title: Associative Reinforcement Learning: Functions in k-DNF  
Abstract: An agent that must learn to act in the world by trial and error faces the reinforcement learning problem, which is quite different from standard concept learning. Although good algorithms exist for this problem in the general case, they are often quite inefficient and do not exhibit generalization. One strategy is to find restricted classes of action policies that can be learned more efficiently. This paper pursues that strategy by developing algorithms that can efficiently learn action maps that are expressible in k-DNF. The algorithms are compared with existing methods in empirical trials and are shown to have very good performance. ",0

Abstract: Novel on-line learning algorithms with self adaptive learning rates (parameters) for blind separation of signals are proposed. The main motivation for development of new learning rules is to improve convergence speed and to reduce cross-talking, especially for non-stationary signals. Furthermore, we have discovered that under some conditions the proposed neural network models with associated learning algorithms exhibit a random switch of attention, i.e. they have ability of chaotic or random switching or cross-over of output signals in such way that a specified separated signal may appear at various outputs at different time windows. Validity, performance and dynamic properties of the proposed learning algorithms are investigated by computer simulation experiments. ","Title: A Quantitative Study of Experimental Evaluations of Neural Network Learning Algorithms: Current Research Practice  
Abstract: 190 articles about neural network learning algorithms published in 1993 and 1994 are examined for the amount of experimental evaluation they contain. 29% of them employ not even a single realistic or real learning problem. Only 8% of the articles present results for more than one problem using real world data. Furthermore, one third of all articles do not present any quantitative comparison with a previously known algorithm. These results suggest that we should strive for better assessment practices in neural network learning algorithm research. For the long-term benefit of the field, the publication standards should be raised in this respect and easily accessible collections of benchmark problems should be built. ",0
"Title: Incremental Learning of Explanation Patterns and their Indices  
Abstract: This paper describes how a reasoner can improve its understanding of an incompletely understood domain through the application of what it already knows to novel problems in that domain. Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good ""lessons"" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations. This is a type of incremental learning since the system improves its explanatory knowledge of the domain in an incremental fashion rather than by learning new XPs as a whole.","Title: Inverting Implication with Small Training Sets  
Abstract: We present an algorithm for inducing recursive clauses using inverse implication (rather than inverse resolution) as the underlying generalization method. Our approach applies to a class of logic programs similar to the class of primitive recursive functions. Induction is performed using a small number of positive examples that need not be along the same resolution path. Our algorithm, implemented in a system named CRUSTACEAN, locates matched lists of generating terms that determine the pattern of decomposition exhibited in the (target) recursive clause. Our theoretical analysis defines the class of logic programs for which our approach is complete, described in terms characteristic of other ILP approaches. Our current implementation is considerably faster than previously reported. We present evidence demonstrating that, given randomly selected inputs, increasing the number of positive examples increases accuracy and reduces the number of outputs. We relate our approach to similar recent work on inducing recursive clauses.",0
"Title: Supporting Conversational Case-Based Reasoning in an Integrated Reasoning Framework  Conversational Case-Based Reasoning  
Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) has been successfully used to assist in case retrieval tasks. However, behavioral limitations of CCBR motivate the search for integrations with other reasoning approaches. This paper briefly describes our group's ongoing efforts towards enhancing the inferencing behaviors of a conversational case-based reasoning development tool named NaCoDAE. In particular, we focus on integrating NaCoDAE with machine learning, model-based reasoning, and generative planning modules. This paper defines CCBR, briefly summarizes the integrations, and explains how they enhance the overall system. Our research focuses on enhancing the performance of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems (Aha & Breslow, 1997). CCBR is a form of case-based reasoning where users initiate problem solving conversations by entering an initial problem description in natural language text. This text is assumed to be a partial rather than a complete problem description. The CCBR system then assists in eliciting refinements of this description and in suggesting solutions. Its primary purpose is to provide a focus of attention for the user so as to quickly provide a solution(s) for their problem. Figure 1 summarizes the CCBR problem solving cycle. Cases in a CCBR library have three components: ","Title: Analysis of Neurocontrollers Designed by Simulated Evolution

This robot is given the task of clearing an arena littered with boxes by pushing boxes to the sides. Through a careful analysis of the evolved networks we show how evolution exploits the design constraints and properties of the environment to produce network structures of high fitness. We conclude with a brief summary of related ongoing research examining the intricate interplay between environment and evolutionary processes in determining the structure and function of the resulting neural architectures.",0

"Title: Feature Selection by Means of a Feature Weighting Approach  
Abstract: Selecting a set of features which is optimal for a given classification task is one of the central problems in machine learning. We address the problem using the flexible and robust filter technique EUBAFES. EUBAFES is based on a feature weighting approach which computes binary feature weights and therefore a solution in the feature selection sense and also gives detailed information about feature relevance by continuous weights. Moreover the user gets not only one but several potentially optimal feature subsets which is important for filter-based feature selection algorithms since it gives the flexibility to use even complex classifiers by the application of a combined filter/wrapper approach. We applied EUBAFES on a number of artificial and real world data sets and used radial basis function networks to examine the impact of the feature subsets to classifier accuracy and complexity.","Title: Discovery of Physical Principles from Design Experiences  
Abstract: One method for making analogies is to access and instantiate abstract domain principles, and one method for acquiring knowledge of abstract principles is to discover them from experience. We view generalization over experiences in the absence of any prior knowledge of the target principle as the task of hypothesis formation, a subtask of discovery. Also, we view the use of the hypothesized principles for analogical design as the task of hypothesis testing, another subtask of discovery. In this paper, we focus on discovery of physical principles by generalization over design experiences in the domain of physical devices. Some important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. We represent a reasoner's comprehension of specific designs in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. An SBF model provides a functional and causal explanation of the working of a device. We represent domain principles as device-independent behavior-function (BF) models. We show that (i) the function of a device determines what to generalize from its SBF model, (ii) the SBF model itself suggests how far to generalize, and (iii) the typology of functions indicates what method to use.

"Title: Cooperation of Data-driven and Model-based Induction Methods for Relational Learning  
Abstract: Inductive learning in relational domains has been shown to be intractable in general. Many approaches to this task have been suggested nevertheless; all in some way restrict the hypothesis space searched. They can be roughly divided into two groups: data-driven, where the restriction is encoded into the algorithm, and model-based, where the restrictions are made more or less explicit with some form of declarative bias. This paper describes Incy, an inductive learner that seeks to combine aspects of both approaches. Incy is initially data-driven, using examples and background knowledge to put forth and specialize hypotheses based on the ""connectivity"" of the data at hand. It is model-driven in that hypotheses are abstracted into rule models, which are used both for control decisions in the data-driven phase and for model-guided induction. Key Words: Inductive learning in relational domains, cooperation of data-driven and model-guided methods, implicit and declarative bias.

"Title: Structured Representation of Complex Stochastic Systems  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of representing complex systems that evolve stochastically over time. Dynamic Bayesian networks provide a compact representation for stochastic processes. Unfortunately, they are often unwieldy since they cannot explicitly model the complex organizational structure of many real life systems: the fact that processes are typically composed of several interacting subprocesses, each of which can, in turn, be further decomposed. We propose a hierarchically structured representation language which extends both dynamic Bayesian networks and the object-oriented Bayesian network framework of [9], and show that our language allows us to describe such systems in a natural and modular way. Our language supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. For example, it allows us to represent systems where some processes evolve at a different rate than others, or systems where the processes interact only intermittently. We provide a simple inference mechanism for our representation via translation to Bayesian networks, and suggest ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in our representation.

"Title: A Connectionist Symbol Manipulator That Discovers the Structure of Context-Free Languages  
Abstract: We present a neural net architecture that can discover hierarchical and recursive structure in symbol strings. To detect structure at multiple levels, the architecture has the capability of reducing symbols substrings to single symbols, and makes use of an external stack memory. In terms of formal languages, the architecture can learn to parse strings in an LR(0) context-free grammar. Given training sets of positive and negative exemplars, the architecture has been trained to recognize many different grammars. The architecture has only one layer of modifiable weights, allowing for a Many cognitive domains involve complex sequences that contain hierarchical or recursive structure, e.g., music, natural language parsing, event perception. To illustrate, ""the spider that ate the hairy fly"" is a noun phrase containing the embedded noun phrase ""the hairy fly."" Understanding such multilevel structures requires forming reduced descriptions (Hinton, 1988) in which a string of symbols or states (""the hairy fly"") is reduced to a single symbolic entity (a noun phrase). We present a neural net architecture that learns to encode the structure of symbol strings via such reduction transformations. The difficult problem of extracting multilevel structure from complex, extended sequences has been studied by Mozer (1992), Ring (1993), Rohwer (1990), and Schmidhuber (1992), among others. While these previous efforts have made some straightforward interpretation of its behavior.","Title: The role of afferent excitatory and lateral inhibitory synaptic plasticity in visual cortical ocular dominance
Abstract: The boosting algorithm AdaBoost, developed by Freund and Schapire, has exhibited outstanding performance on several benchmark problems when using C4.5 as the ""weak"" algorithm to be ""boosted."" Like other ensemble learning approaches, AdaBoost constructs a composite hypothesis by voting many individual hypotheses. In practice, the large amount of memory required to store these hypotheses can make ensemble methods hard to deploy in applications. This paper shows that by selecting a subset of the hypotheses, it is possible to obtain nearly the same levels of performance as the entire set. The results also provide some insight into the behavior of AdaBoost.",0
"Title: Cryptographic Limitations on Learning Boolean Formulae and Finite Automata  
Abstract: In this paper we prove the intractability of learning several classes of Boolean functions in the distribution-free model (also called the Probably Approximately Correct or PAC model) of learning from examples. These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography. We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a gener - alization of graph coloring. fl This research was conducted while the author was at Harvard University and supported by an A.T.& T.

Abstract: The problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane, attempting to separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls in n-dimensional real space, is formulated as a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC).

A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ""counts"" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.",0

"Title: Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive Induction Approach  
Abstract: Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.","Title: EEG Signal Classification with Different Signal Representations  for a large number of hidden units.

One of them is discretization of numerical attributes, based on Fayyad and Irani's text [9], but adapted and extended in such a way that it can cope with some aspects of discretization that only occur in relational learning problems (when indeterminate literals occur). The second technique is lookahead. It is a well-known problem in ILP that a learner cannot always assess the quality of a refinement without knowing which refinements will be enabled afterwards, i.e. without looking ahead in the refinement lattice. We present a simple method for specifying when lookahead is to be used, and what kind of lookahead is interesting. Both the discretization and lookahead techniques are evaluated experimentally. The results show that both techniques improve the quality of the induced theory, while computational costs are acceptable.","Title: Estimating Attributes: Analysis and Extensions of RELIEF

"Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Model Determination for Hierarchical and Graphical Log-linear Models  
Abstract: The Bayesian approach to comparing models involves calculating the posterior probability of each plausible model. For high-dimensional contingency tables, the set of plausible models is very large. We focus attention on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (Green, 1995) and develop strategies for calculating posterior probabilities of hierarchical, graphical or decomposable log-linear models. Even for tables of moderate size, these sets of models may be very large. The choice of suitable prior distributions for model parameters is also discussed in detail, and two examples are presented. For the first example, a 2 fi 3 fi 4 table, the model probabilities calculated using our reversible jump approach are compared with model probabilities calculated exactly or by using an alternative approximation. The second example is a 2 6 contingency table for which exact methods are infeasible, due to the large number of possible models. ","Title: Minimax Estimation via Wavelet Shrinkage  a pleasure to acknowledge friendly conversations with Gerard Kerkyacharian,  
Abstract: We attempt to recover an unknown function from noisy, sampled data. Using orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets we develop a nonlinear method which works in the wavelet domain by simple nonlinear shrinkage of the empirical wavelet coefficients. The shrinkage can be tuned to be nearly minimax over any member of a wide range of Triebel- and Besov-type smoothness constraints, and asymptotically minimax over Besov bodies with p q. Linear estimates cannot achieve even the minimax rates over Triebel and Besov classes with p &lt; 2, so our method can significantly outperform every linear method (kernel, smoothing spline, sieve, : : : ) in a minimax sense. Variants of our method based on simple threshold nonlinearities are nearly minimax. Our method possesses the interpretation of spatial adaptivity: it reconstructs using a kernel which may vary in shape and bandwidth from point to point, depending on the data. Least favorable distributions for certain of the Triebel and Besov scales generate objects with sparse wavelet transforms. Many real objects have similarly sparse transforms, which suggests that these minimax results are relevant for practical problems. Sequels to this paper discuss practical implementation, spatial adaptation properties and applications to inverse problems. Acknowledgements.

"Title: LOCAL ADAPTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR BLIND SEPARATION OF NATURAL IMAGES  
Abstract: In this paper a neural network approach for reconstruction of natural highly correlated images from linear (additive) mixture of them is proposed. A multi-layer architecture with local on-line learning rules is developed to solve the problem of blind separation of sources. The main motivation for using a multi-layer network instead of a single-layer one is to improve the performance and robustness of separation, while applying a very simple local learning rule, which is biologically plausible. Moreover such architecture with on-chip learning is relatively easy implementable using VLSI electronic circuits. Furthermore it enables the extraction of source signals sequentially one after the other, starting from the strongest signal and finishing with the weakest one. The experimental part focuses on separating highly correlated human faces from mixture of them, with additive noise and under unknown number of sources.

Abstract: A distinct advantage of symbolic learning algorithms over artificial neural networks is that typically the concept representations they form are more easily understood by humans. One approach to understanding the representations formed by neural networks is to extract symbolic rules from trained networks. In this paper we describe and investigate an approach for extracting rules from networks that uses (1) the NofM extraction algorithm, and (2) the network training method of soft weight-sharing. Previously, the NofM algorithm had been successfully applied only to knowledge-based neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our extracted rules generalize better than rules learned using the C4.5 system. In addition to being accurate, our extracted rules are also reasonably comprehensible.",0

The bounds apply when in-sample and out-of-sample data are drawn from the same distribution. Partition-based bounds are stronger than VC-type bounds, but they require more computation.

We both contribute to the line of research on playing games against finite automata, and expand the scope of this research by considering new classes of adversaries. We introduce the natural notions of games against recent history adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple boolean formula on the recent history of play), and games against statistical adversaries (whose current action is determined by some simple function of the statistics of the entire history of play). In both cases we give efficient algorithms for learning to play penny-matching and a more difficult game called contract . We also give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata, an efficient algorithm for learning to play any game against any finite automata with probabilistic actions and low cover time.

"Title: Learning Active Classifiers  
Abstract: Many classification algorithms are ""passive"", in that they assign a class-label to each instance based only on the description given, even if that description is incomplete. In contrast, an active classifier can | at some cost | obtain the values of missing attributes, before deciding upon a class label. The expected utility of using an active classifier depends on both the cost required to obtain the additional attribute values and the penalty incurred if it outputs the wrong classification. This paper considers the problem of learning near-optimal active classifiers, using a variant of the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) model. After defining the framework | which is perhaps the main contribution of this paper | we describe a situation where this task can be achieved efficiently, but then show that the task is often intractable. ","Title: Bayesian Induction of Features in Temporal Domains  
Abstract: Most concept induction algorithms process concept instances described in terms of properties that remain constant over time. In temporal domains, instances are best described in terms of properties whose values vary with time. Data engineering is called upon in temporal domains to transform the raw data into an appropriate form for concept induction. I investigate a method for inducing features suitable for classifying finite, univariate, time series that are governed by unknown deterministic processes contaminated by noise. In a supervised setting, I induce piecewise polynomials of appropriate complexity to characterize the data in each class, using Bayesian model induction principles. In this study, I evaluate the proposed method empirically in a semi-deterministic domain: the waveform classification problem, originally presented in the CART book. I compared the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm to the accuracy attained by C4.5 under various noise levels. Feature induction improved the classification accuracy in noisy situations, but degraded it when there was no noise. The results demonstrate the value of the proposed method in the presence of noise, and reveal a weakness shared by all classifiers using generative rather than discriminative models: sensitivity to model inaccuracies.

"Title: Statistical Theory of Overtraining Is Cross-Validation Asymptotically Effective?  
Abstract: A statistical theory for overtraining is proposed. The analysis treats realizable stochastic neural networks, trained with Kullback-Leibler loss in the asymptotic case. It is shown that the asymptotic gain in the generalization error is small if we perform early stopping, even if we have access to the optimal stopping time. Considering cross-validation stopping we answer the question: In what ratio the examples should be divided into training and testing sets in order to obtain the optimum performance. In the non-asymptotic region cross-validated early stopping always decreases the generalization error. Our large scale simulations done on a CM5 are in nice agreement with our analytical findings.

Abstract: This paper specifies the main features of Brain-like, Neuronal, and Connectionist models; argues for the need for, and usefulness of, appropriate successively larger brain-like structures; and examines parallel-hierarchical Recognition Cone models of perception from this perspective, as examples of such structures. The anatomy, physiology, behavior, and development of the visual system are briefly summarized to motivate the architecture of brain-structured networks for perceptual recognition. Results are presented from simulations of carefully pre-designed Recognition Cone structures that perceive objects (e.g., houses) in digitized photographs. A framework for perceptual learning is introduced, including mechanisms for generation-discovery (feedback-guided growth of new links and nodes, subject to brain-like constraints (e.g., local receptive fields, global convergence-divergence). The information processing transforms discovered through generation are fine-tuned by feedback-guided reweight-ing of links. Some preliminary results are presented of brain-structured networks that learn to recognize simple objects (e.g., letters of the alphabet, cups, apples, bananas) through feedback-guided generation and reweighting. These show large improvements over networks that either lack brain-like structure or/and learn by reweighting of links alone. ",0

When coupled with a dynamic program to compute the most likely sequence, new consensus sequences emerge. The consensus sequence information is summarized in conditional probability matrices which, when used to locate signals in uncharacter-ized genomic DNA, have greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional matrices. Species-specific versions of these matrices are especially effective at distinguishing true and false sites. ","Title: An Evolutionary Approach to Learning in Robots

","Title: Space-Time Scheduling of Instruction-Level Parallelism on a Raw Machine  
Abstract: Advances in VLSI technology will enable chips with over a billion transistors within the next decade. Unfortunately, the centralized-resource architectures of modern microprocessors are ill-suited to exploit such advances. Achieving a high level of parallelism at a reasonable clock speed requires distributing the processor resources a trend already visible in the dual-register-file architecture of the Alpha 21264. A Raw microprocessor takes an extreme position in this space by distributing all its resources such as instruction streams, register files, memory ports, and ALUs over a pipelined two-dimensional interconnect, and exposing them fully to the compiler. Compilation for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) on such distributed-resource machines requires both spatial instruction scheduling and traditional temporal instruction scheduling. This paper describes the techniques used by the Raw compiler to handle these issues. Preliminary results from a SUIF-based compiler for sequential programs written in C and Fortran indicate that the Raw approach to exploiting ILP can achieve speedups scalable with the number of processors for applications with such parallelism. The Raw architecture attempts to provide performance that is at least comparable to that provided by scaling an existing architecture, but that can achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance for applications with a large amount of parallelism. This paper offers some positive results in this direction. ",0
"Title: Learning in the Presence of Malicious Errors  
Abstract: In this paper we study an extension of the distribution-free model of learning introduced by Valiant [23] (also known as the probably approximately correct or PAC model) that allows the presence of malicious errors in the examples given to a learning algorithm. Such errors are generated by an adversary with unbounded computational power and access to the entire history of the learning algorithm's computation. Thus, we study a worst-case model of errors. Our results include general methods for bounding the rate of error tolerable by any learning algorithm, efficient algorithms tolerating nontrivial rates of malicious errors, and equivalences between problems of learning with errors and standard combinatorial optimization problems.","Title: Constructing Bayesian finite mixture models by the EM algorithm  
Abstract: Email: Firstname.Lastname@cs.Helsinki.FI Report C-1996-9, University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science. Abstract In this paper we explore the use of finite mixture models for building decision support systems capable of sound probabilistic inference. Finite mixture models have many appealing properties: they are computationally efficient in the prediction (reasoning) phase, they are universal in the sense that they can approximate any problem domain distribution, and they can handle multimod-ality well. We present a formulation of the model construction problem in the Bayesian framework for finite mixture models, and describe how Bayesian inference is performed given such a model. The model construction problem can be seen as missing data estimation and we describe a realization of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for finding good models. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we report crossvalidated empirical results on several publicly available classification problem datasets, and compare our results to corresponding results obtained by alternative techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees. The comparison is based on the best results reported in the literature on the datasets in question. It appears that using the theoretically sound Bayesian framework suggested here the other reported results can be outperformed with a relatively small effort. ",0
"Title: Constructive Neural Network Learning Algorithms for Multi-Category Real-Valued Pattern Classification  
Abstract: Prioritized sweeping is a model-based reinforcement learning method that attempts to focus an agent's limited computational resources to achieve a good estimate of the value of environment states. To choose effectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweeping uses a simple heuristic to focus computation on the states that are likely to have the largest errors. In this paper, we introduce generalized prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates in a representation-specific manner. This allows us to extend prioritized sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with compact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces. We apply this method for generalized model approximators (such as Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare our approach with classical prioritized sweeping. ","Title: A Practical Bayesian Framework for Backprop Networks  
Abstract: A quantitative and practical Bayesian framework is described for learning of mappings in feedforward networks. The framework makes possible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of magnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers (for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (5) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning and interpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. The Bayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,' penalising over-flexible and over-complex models. The Bayesian approach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlation between generalisation ability and the Bayesian evidence is obtained. This paper makes use of the Bayesian framework for regularisation and model comparison described in the companion paper `Bayesian interpolation' (MacKay, 1991a). This framework is due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a). ",0
"Title: Learning to coordinate without sharing information  
Abstract: Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) have been developing efficient mechanisms to coordinate the activities of multiple autonomous agents. The need for coordination arises because agents have to share resources and expertise required to achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes using sophisticated information exchange protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models of possibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In order to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamic environments, we propose learning as a means to provide additional possibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agents can learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without any knowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze and experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence, and demonstrate benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems. Reinforcement learning based coordination can be achieved in both cooperative and non-cooperative domains, and in domains with noisy communication channels and other stochastic characteristics that present a formidable challenge to using other coordination schemes.

Abstract: We propose a new processing paradigm, called the Expandable Split Window (ESW) paradigm, for exploiting fine-grain parallelism. This paradigm considers a window of instructions (possibly having dependencies) as a single unit, and exploits fine-grain parallelism by overlapping the execution of multiple windows. The basic idea is to connect multiple sequential processors, in a decoupled and decentralized manner, to achieve overall multiple issue. This processing paradigm shares a number of properties of the restricted dataflow machines, but was derived from the sequential von Neumann architecture. We also present an implementation of the Expandable Split Window execution model, and preliminary performance results.

We assume that there is an unknown product distribution D over Q d such that all instances are independently drawn according to D. The accuracy of a hypothesis is measured by the probability that it would incorrectly predict whether one of n more points drawn from D was in the rectangle to be learned.

For this, we distinguish two types of such applications, namely (a) the case of distributed case libraries and (b) the case of distributed cases. While a solution to the former is straightforward, the latter requires an extension to Case Retrieval Nets which provides a kind of partitioning of the entire net structure. This extended model even allows for a concurrent implementation of the retrieval process or for the use of collaborative agents for retrieval.

"Title: Incremental Learning of Explanation Patterns and their Indices  
Abstract: This paper describes how a reasoner can improve its understanding of an incompletely understood domain through the application of what it already knows to novel problems in that domain. Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good ""lessons"" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations. This is a type of incremental learning since the system improves its explanatory knowledge of the domain in an incremental fashion rather than by learning new XPs as a whole.","Title: Bayesian curve fitting using multivariate normal mixtures  
Abstract: Problems of regression smoothing and curve fitting are addressed via predictive inference in a flexible class of mixture models. Multi-dimensional density estimation using Dirichlet mixture models provides the theoretical basis for semi-parametric regression methods in which fitted regression functions may be deduced as means of conditional predictive distributions. These Bayesian regression functions have features similar to generalised kernel regression estimates, but the formal analysis addresses problems of multivariate smoothing parameter estimation and the assessment of uncertainties about regression functions naturally. Computations are based on multi-dimensional versions of existing Markov chain simulation analysis of univariate Dirichlet mixture models. ",0
"Title: A MEAN FIELD LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR UNSUPERVISED NEURAL NETWORKS  
Abstract: We introduce a learning algorithm for unsupervised neural networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The algorithm is derived from a mean field approximation for large, layered sigmoid belief networks. We show how to (approximately) infer the statistics of these networks without resort to sampling. This is done by solving the mean field equations, which relate the statistics of each unit to those of its Markov blanket. Using these statistics as target values, the weights in the network are adapted by a local delta rule. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these networks for problems in statistical pattern recognition. ","Title: Multi-parent Recombination

We pay special attention to this latter type of operators and summarize results on the effect of operator arity on EA performance. ",0
"Title: A note on acceptance rate criteria for CLTs for Hastings-Metropolis algorithms  
Abstract: This note considers positive recurrent Markov chains where the probability of remaining in the current state is arbitrarily close to 1. Specifically, conditions are given which ensure the non-existence of central limit theorems for ergodic averages of functionals of the chain. The results are motivated by applications for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms which are constructed in terms of a rejection probability, (where a rejection involves remaining at the current state). Two examples for commonly used algorithms are given, for the independence sampler and the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. The examples are rather specialised, although in both cases, the problems which arise are typical of problems commonly occurring for the particular algorithm being used. 0 I would like to thank Kerrie Mengersen Jeff Rosenthal and Richard Tweedie for useful conversations on the subject of this paper. ","Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Diagnostics: A Comparative Review  
Abstract: A critical issue for users of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.

"Title: From: Computational Learning Theory and Natural Systems, Chapter 18, ""Cross-validation and Modal Theories"", Cross-Validation and
Abstract: Cross-validation is a frequently used, intuitively pleasing technique for estimating the accuracy of theories learned by machine learning algorithms. During testing of a machine learning algorithm (foil) on new databases of prokaryotic RNA transcription promoters which we have developed, cross-validation displayed an interesting phenomenon. One theory is found repeatedly and is responsible for very little of the cross-validation error, whereas other theories are found very infrequently which tend to be responsible for the majority of the cross-validation error. It is tempting to believe that the most frequently found theory (the ""modal theory"") may be more accurate as a classifier of unseen data than the other theories. However, experiments showed that modal theories are not more accurate on unseen data than the other theories found less frequently during cross-validation. Modal theories may be useful in predicting when cross-validation is a poor estimate of true accuracy.

Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a reasoner must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires declarative representations of meta-knowledge of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task, of the system's knowledge, and of the organization of this knowledge. This chapter presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during a performance task, declarative representations of these failures, and associations between failures and particular learning strategies. The theory is based on Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types, formulate learning goals, and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. The theory is implemented in a computer model of an introspective reasoner that performs multistrategy learning during a story understanding task. ",0

Abstract: We present a new method, inspired by the bootstrap, whose goal it is to determine the quality and reliability of a neural network predictor. Our method leads to more robust forecasting along with a large amount of statistical information on forecast performance that we exploit. We exhibit the method in the context of multi-variate time series prediction on financial data from the New York Stock Exchange. It turns out that the variation due to different resamplings (i.e., splits between training, cross-validation, and test sets) is significantly larger than the variation due to different network conditions (such as architecture and initial weights). Furthermore, this method allows us to forecast a probability distribution, as opposed to the traditional case of just a single value at each time step. We demonstrate this on a strictly held-out test set that includes the 1987 stock market crash. We also compare the performance of the class of neural networks to identically bootstrapped linear models.",0
"Title: Using Knowledge of Cognitive Behavior to Learn from Failure  
Abstract: When learning from reasoning failures, knowledge of how a system behaves is a powerful lever for deciding what went wrong with the system and in deciding what the system needs to learn. A number of benefits arise when systems possess knowledge of their own operation and of their own knowledge. Abstract knowledge about cognition can be used to select diagnosis and repair strategies from among alternatives. Specific kinds of self-knowledge can be used to distinguish between failure hypothesis candidates. Making self-knowledge explicit can also facilitate the use of such knowledge across domains and can provide a principled way to incorporate new learning strategies. To illustrate the advantages of self-knowledge for learning, we provide implemented examples from two different systems: A plan execution system called RAPTER and a story understanding system called Meta-AQUA. ","Title: Generalized Update: Belief Change in Dynamic Settings  
Abstract: Belief revision and belief update have been proposed as two types of belief change serving different purposes. Belief revision is intended to capture changes of an agent's belief state reflecting new information about a static world. Belief update is intended to capture changes of belief in response to a changing world. We argue that both belief revision and belief update are too restrictive; routine belief change involves elements of both. We present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change. We show that, under certain assumptions, the original update postulates are satisfied. We also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model, in a way that formally verifies the intuition that revision is suitable for static belief change.",0
"Title: Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive Induction Approach  
Abstract: Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.","Title: On the Testability of Causal Models with Latent and Instrumental Variables  
Abstract: Certain causal models involving unmeasured variables induce no independence constraints among the observed variables but imply, nevertheless, inequality constraints on the observed distribution. This paper derives a general formula for such inequality constraints as induced by instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account for the data, or, conversely, whether a given vari able can be deemed instrumental.",0
"Title: Learning Generic Mechanisms from Experiences for Analogical Reasoning  
Abstract: Humans appear to often solve problems in a new domain by transferring their expertise from a more familiar domain. However, making such cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions used by designers. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from problem-solving experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. In this paper, we show that mental models in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences. In particular, we show how the model-based learning method integrated with similarity-based learning addresses the issues in generalization from experiences. ","Title: A Unified Gradient-Descent/Clustering Architecture for Finite State Machine Induction  
Abstract: Although recurrent neural nets have been moderately successful in learning to emulate finite-state machines (FSMs), the continuous internal state dynamics of a neural net are not well matched to the discrete behavior of an FSM. We describe an architecture, called DOLCE, that allows discrete states to evolve in a net as learning progresses. dolce consists of a standard recurrent neural net trained by gradient descent and an adaptive clustering technique that quantizes the state space. dolce is based on the assumption that a finite set of discrete internal states is required for the task, and that the actual network state belongs to this set but has been corrupted by noise due to inaccuracy in the weights. dolce learns to recover the discrete state with maximum a posteriori probability from the noisy state. Simulations show that dolce leads to a significant improvement in generalization performance over earlier neural net approaches to FSM induction.",0
"Title: Uncertain Inferences and Uncertain Conclusions  
Abstract: Uncertainty may be taken to characterize inferences, their conclusions, their premises or all three. Under some treatments of uncertainty, the inference itself is never characterized by uncertainty. We explore both the significance of uncertainty in the premises and in the conclusion of an argument that involves uncertainty. We argue that for uncertainty to characterize the conclusion of an inference is natural, but that there is an interplay between uncertainty in the premises and uncertainty in the procedure of argument itself. We show that it is possible in principle to incorporate all uncertainty in the premises, rendering uncertainty arguments deductively valid. But we then argue (1) that this does not reflect human argument, (2) that it is computationally costly, and (3) that the gain in simplicity obtained by allowing uncertainty in inference can sometimes outweigh the loss of flexibility it entails.

Each run is generated by independent random draws from a distribution ~p i over S, where ~p i is an element in a set of distributions f~p 1 ; : : : ; ~p N g.

Abstract: Dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs) are a useful tool for modeling complex stochastic processes. The simplest inference task in DPNs is monitoring | that is, computing a posterior distribution for the state variables at each time step given all observations up to that time. Recursive, constant-space algorithms are well-known for monitoring in DPNs and other models. This paper is concerned with hindsight | that is, computing a posterior distribution given both past and future observations. Hindsight is an essential subtask of learning DPN models from data. Existing algorithms for hindsight in DPNs use O(SN ) space and time, where N is the total length of the observation sequence and S is the state space size for each time step. They are therefore impractical for hindsight in complex models with long observation sequences. This paper presents an O(S log N ) space, O(SN log N ) time hindsight algorithm. We demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in two real-world DPN learning problems. We also discuss the possibility of an O(S)-space, O(SN )-time algorithm.

Abstract: Over the years there has been several packages developed that provide a workbench for genetic algorithm (GA) research. Most of these packages use the generational model inspired by GENESIS.

It offers an easy to use `user-friendly' interface and allows comparisons to be made between both generational and steady-state genetic algorithms for a particular problem. It includes a variety of genetic operators for reproduction, crossover, and mutation. LibGA makes it easy to use these operators in new ways for particular applications or to develop and include new operators. Finally, it offers the unique new feature of a dynamic generation gap. ",0
"Title: Parallel Gradient Distribution in Unconstrained Optimization  
Abstract: A parallel version is proposed for a fundamental theorem of serial unconstrained optimization. The parallel theorem allows each of k parallel processors to use simultaneously a different algorithm, such as a descent, Newton, quasi-Newton or a conjugate gradient algorithm. Each processor can perform one or many steps of a serial algorithm on a portion of the gradient of the objective function assigned to it, independently of the other processors. Eventually a synchronization step is performed which, for differentiable convex functions, consists of taking a strong convex combination of the k points found by the k processors. For nonconvex, as well as convex, differentiable functions, the best point found by the k processors is taken, or any better point. The fundamental result that we establish is that any accumulation point of the parallel algorithm is stationary for the nonconvex case, and is a global solution for the convex case. Computational testing on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor indicate a speedup of the order of the number of processors employed.

Abstract: This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing conjunctions as new attributes for decision tree learning. It searches for conditions (attribute-value pairs) from paths to form new attributes. Compared with other hypothesis-driven new attribute construction methods, the new idea of this method is that it carries out systematic search with pruning over each path of a tree to select conditions for generating a conjunction. Therefore, conditions for constructing new attributes are dynamically decided during search. Empirically evaluation in a set of artificial and real-world domains shows that the dynamic path-based method can improve the performance of selective decision tree learning in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. In addition, it shows some performance advantages over a fixed path-based method and a fixed rule-based method for learning decision trees. ",0
"Title: Compression-Based Feature Subset Selection  Keywords: Minimum Description Length Principle, Cross Validation, Noise  
Abstract: Irrelevant and redundant features may reduce both predictive accuracy and comprehensibility of induced concepts. Most common Machine Learning approaches for selecting a good subset of relevant features rely on cross-validation. As an alternative, we present the application of a particular Minimum Description Length (MDL) measure to the task of feature subset selection. Using the MDL principle allows taking into account all of the available data at once. The new measure is information-theoretically plausible and yet still simple and therefore efficiently computable. We show empirically that this new method for judging the value of feature subsets is more efficient than and performs at least as well as methods based on cross-validation. Domains with both a large number of training examples and a large number of possible features yield the biggest gains in efficiency. Thus our new approach seems to scale up better to large learning problems than previous methods. ","Title: The Pandemonium System of Reflective Agents

"Title: A Neural Network Model of Visual Tilt Aftereffects  
Abstract: RF-LISSOM, a self-organizing model of laterally connected orientation maps in the primary visual cortex, was used to study the psychological phenomenon known as the tilt aftereffect. The same self-organizing processes that are responsible for the long-term development of the map and its lateral connections are shown to result in tilt aftereffects over short time scales in the adult. The model allows observing large numbers of neurons and connections simultaneously, making it possible to relate higher-level phenomena to low-level events, which is difficult to do experimentally. The results give computational support for the idea that direct tilt aftereffects arise from adaptive lateral interactions between feature detectors, as has long been surmised. They also suggest that indirect effects could result from the conservation of synaptic resources during this process. The model thus provides a unified computational explanation of self-organization and both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects in the primary visual cortex.

Incorporating tangent-plane information [12] about expected local deformations only requires adding tangent vectors into the sample covariance matrices for the PCA, and it demonstrably improves performance.",0
"Title: In Search Of Articulated Attractors  
Abstract: Recurrent attractor networks offer many advantages over feed-forward networks for the modeling of psychological phenomena. Their dynamic nature allows them to capture the time course of cognitive processing, and their learned weights may often be easily interpreted as soft constraints between representational components. Perhaps the most significant feature of such networks, however, is their ability to facilitate generalization by enforcing well formedness constraints on intermediate and output representations. Attractor networks which learn the systematic regularities of well formed representations by exposure to a small number of examples are said to possess articulated attractors. This paper investigates the conditions under which articulated attractors arise in recurrent networks trained using variants of backpropagation. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that such structured attrac-tors can spontaneously appear in an emergence of systematic-ity, if an appropriate error signal is presented directly to the recurrent processing elements. We show, however, that distal error signals, backpropagated through intervening weights, pose serious problems for networks of this kind. We present simulation results, discuss the reasons for this difficulty, and suggest some directions for future attempts to surmount it. ","Title: Case-based reactive navigation: A case-based method for on-line selection and adaptation of reactive control parameters
Abstract: This article presents a new line of research investigating on-line learning mechanisms for autonomous intelligent agents. We discuss a case-based method for dynamic selection and modification of behavior assemblages for a navigational system. The case-based reasoning module is designed as an addition to a traditional reactive control system, and provides more flexible performance in novel environments without extensive high-level reasoning that would otherwise slow the system down. The method is implemented in the ACBARR (A Case-BAsed Reactive Robotic) system, and evaluated through empirical simulation of the system on several different environments, including ""box canyon"" environments known to be problematic for reactive control systems in general. fl Technical Report GIT-CC-92/57, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Geor gia, 1992.

"Title: VISIT: An Efficient Computational Model of Human Visual Attention  
Abstract: One of the challenges for models of cognitive phenomena is the development of efficient and exible interfaces between low level sensory information and high level processes. For visual processing, researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many of the tasks required by high level vision. This thesis presents VISIT, a connectionist model of covert visual attention that has been used as a vehicle for studying this interface. The model is efficient, exible, and is biologically plausible. The complexity of the network is linear in the number of pixels. Effective parallel strategies are used to minimize the number of iterations required. The resulting system is able to efficiently solve two tasks that are particularly difficult for standard bottom-up models of vision: computing spatial relations and visual search. Simulations show that the networks behavior matches much of the known psychophysical data on human visual attention. The general architecture of the model also closely matches the known physiological data on the human attention system. Various extensions to VISIT are discussed, including methods for learning the component modules. ","Title: Predicting Conditional Probability Distributions: A Connectionist Approach  
Abstract: Most traditional prediction techniques deliver the mean of the probability distribution (a single point). For multimodal processes, instead of predicting the mean of the probability distribution, it is important to predict the full distribution. This article presents a new connectionist method to predict the conditional probability distribution in response to an input. The main idea is to transform the problem from a regression to a classification problem. The conditional probability distribution network can perform both direct predictions and iterated predictions, a task which is specific for time series problems. We compare our method to fuzzy logic and discuss important differences, and also demonstrate the architecture on two time series. The first is the benchmark laser series used in the Santa Fe competition, a deterministic chaotic system. The second is a time series from a Markov process which exhibits structure on two time scales. The network produces multimodal predictions for this series. We compare the predictions of the network with a nearest-neighbor predictor and find that the conditional probability network is more than twice as likely a model.",0
"Title: ASPECTS OF GRAPHICAL MODELS CONNECTED WITH CAUSALITY  
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of graphs as a mathematical tool for expressing independenices, and as a formal language for communicating and processing causal information in statistical analysis. We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation. We exemplify the tradeoffs between the two approaches by deriving nonparametric bounds on treatment effects under conditions of imperfect compliance. ","Title: Dirichlet Mixtures: A Method for Improving Detection of Weak but Significant Protein Sequence Homology  
Abstract: UCSC Technical Report UCSC-CRL-96-09 Abstract This paper presents the mathematical foundations of Dirichlet mixtures, which have been used to improve database search results for homologous sequences, when a variable number of sequences from a protein family or domain are known. We present a method for condensing the information in a protein database into a mixture of Dirichlet densities. These mixtures are designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies, to form estimates of expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden Markov model, or other statistical model. These estimates give a statistical model greater generalization capacity, such that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the model. Dirichlet mixtures have been shown to outperform substitution matrices and other methods for computing these expected amino acid distributions in database search, resulting in fewer false positives and false negatives for the families tested. This paper corrects a previously published formula for estimating these expected probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.

Abstract: The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail has been repeatedly used as a benchmark problem. Recently we have shown performance of several techniques is not much better than the best performance obtainable using uniform random search. We suggested that this could be because the program fitness landscape is difficult for hill climbers and the problem is also difficult for Genetic Algorithms as it contains multiple levels of deception. Here we redefine the problem so the ant is obliged to traverse the trail in approximately the correct order. A simple genetic programming system, with no size or depth restriction, is show to perform approximately three times better with the improved training function.",0
"Title: Extending Theory Refinement to M-of-N Rules  
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning research has started addressing a problem known as theory refinement. The goal of a theory refinement learner is to modify an incomplete or incorrect rule base, representing a domain theory, to make it consistent with a set of input training examples. This paper presents a major revision of the Either propositional theory refinement system. Two issues are discussed. First, we show how run time efficiency can be greatly improved by changing from a exhaustive scheme for computing repairs to an iterative greedy method. Second, we show how to extend Either to refine M-of-N rules. The resulting algorithm, Neither (New Either), is more than an order of magnitude faster and produces significantly more accurate results with theories that fit the M-of-N format. To demonstrate the advantages of Neither, we present experimental results from two real-world domains. ","Title: High-Performance Job-Shop Scheduling With A Time-Delay TD() Network  
Abstract: Job-shop scheduling is an important task for manufacturing industries. We are interested in the particular task of scheduling payload processing for NASA's space shuttle program. This paper summarizes our previous work on formulating this task for solution by the reinforcement learning algorithm T D(). A shortcoming of this previous work was its reliance on hand-engineered input features. This paper shows how to extend the time-delay neural network (TDNN) architecture to apply it to irregular-length schedules. Experimental tests show that this TDNN-T D() network can match the performance of our previous hand-engineered system. The tests also show that both neural network approaches significantly outperform the best previous (non-learning) solution to this problem in terms of the quality of the resulting schedules and the number of search steps required to construct them.",0
"Title: Generalized Prioritized Sweeping  
Abstract: Prioritized sweeping is a model-based reinforcement learning method that attempts to focus an agent's limited computational resources to achieve a good estimate of the value of environment states. To choose effectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweeping uses a simple heuristic to focus computation on the states that are likely to have the largest errors. In this paper, we introduce generalized prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates in a representation-specific manner. This allows us to extend prioritized sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with compact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces. We apply this method for generalized model approximators (such as Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare our approach with classical prioritized sweeping.

"Title: Automatic Indexing, Retrieval and Reuse of Topologies in Architectual Layouts  
Abstract: Former layouts contain much of the know-how of architects. A generic and automatic way to formalize this know-how in order to use it by a computer would save a lot of effort and money. However, there seems to be no such way. The only access to the know-how are the layouts themselves. Developing a generic software tool to reuse former layouts you cannot consider every part of the architectual domain or things like personal style. Tools used today only consider small parts of the architectual domain. Any personal style is ignored. Isn't it possible to build a basic tool which is adjusted by the content of the former layouts, but may be extended incremently by modeling as much of the domain as desirable? This paper will describe a reuse tool to perform this task focusing on topological and geometrical binary relations.","Title: Nonsmooth Dynamic Simulation With Linear Programming Based Methods  
Abstract: Process simulation has emerged as a valuable tool for process design, analysis and operation. In this work, we extend the capabilities of iterated linear programming (LP) for dealing with problems encountered in dynamic nonsmooth process simulation. A previously developed LP method is refined with the addition of a new descent strategy which combines line search with a trust region approach. This adds more stability and efficiency to the method. The LP method has the advantage of naturally dealing with profile bounds as well. This is demonstrated to avoid the computational difficulties which arise from the iterates going into physically unrealistic regions. A new method for the treatment of discontinuities occurring in dynamic simulation problems is also presented in this paper. The method ensures that any event which has occurred within the time interval in consideration is detected and if more than one event occurs, the detected one is indeed the earliest one. A specific class of implicitly discontinuous process simulation problems, phase equilibrium calculations is also looked at. A new formulation is introduced to solve multiphase problems. fl To whom all correspondence should be addressed. email:biegler@cmu.edu",0
"Title: A proposal for variable selection in the Cox model  
Abstract: GMD Report #633 Abstract Many of the current artificial neural network systems have serious limitations, concerning accessibility, flexibility, scaling and reliability. In order to go some way to removing these we suggest a reflective neural network architecture. In such an architecture, the modular structure is the most important element. The building-block elements are called ""minos' modules. They perform self-observation and inform on the current level of development, or scope of expertise, within the module. A Pandemonium system integrates such submodules so that they work together to handle mapping tasks. Network complexity limitations are attacked in this way with the Pandemonium problem decomposition paradigm, and both static and dynamic unreliability of the whole Pandemonium system is effectively eliminated through the generation and interpretation of confidence and ambiguity measures at every moment during the development of the system. Two problem domains are used to test and demonstrate various aspects of our architecture. Reliability and quality measures are defined for systems that only answer part of the time. Our system achieves better quality values than single networks of larger size for a handwritten digit problem. When both second and third best answers are accepted, our system is left with only 5% error on the test set, 2.1% better than the best single net. It is also shown how the system can elegantly learn to handle garbage patterns. With the parity problem it is demonstrated how complexity of problems may be decomposed automatically by the system, through solving it with networks of size smaller than a single net is required to be. Even when the system does not find a solution to the parity problem, because networks of too small a size are used, the reliability remains around 99-100%. Our Pandemonium architecture gives more power and flexibility to the higher levels of a large hybrid system than a single net system can, offering useful information for higher-level feedback loops, through which reliability of answers may be intelligently traded for less reliable but important ""intuitional"" answers. In providing weighted alternatives and possible generalizations, this architecture gives the best possible service to the larger system of which it will form part. ","Title: Constructive Belief and Rational Representation  
Abstract: It is commonplace in artificial intelligence to divide an agent's explicit beliefs into two parts: the beliefs explicitly represented or manifest in memory, and the implicitly represented or constructive beliefs that are repeatedly reconstructed when needed rather than memorized. Many theories of knowledge view the relation between manifest and constructive beliefs as a logical relation, with the manifest beliefs representing the constructive beliefs through a logic of belief. This view, however, limits the ability of a theory to treat incomplete or inconsistent sets of beliefs in useful ways. We argue that a more illuminating view is that belief is the result of rational representation. In this theory, the agent obtains its constructive beliefs by using its manifest beliefs and preferences to rationally (in the sense of decision theory) choose the most useful conclusions indicated by the manifest beliefs.",0
"Title: Modeling dynamic receptive field changes produced by intracortical microstimulation  
Abstract: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of a localized site in the somatosensory cortex of rats and monkeys for 2-6 hours produces a large increase in the cortical representation of the skin region represented by the ICMS-site neurons before ICMS, with very little effect on the ICMS-site neuron's RF location, RF size, and responsiveness (Recanzone et al., 1992). The ""EXIN"" (afferent excitatory and lateral inhibitory) learning rules (Marshall, 1995) are used to model RF changes during ICMS. The EXIN model produces reorganization of RF topography similar to that observed experimentally. The possible role of inhibitory learning in producing the effects of ICMS is studied by simulating the EXIN model with only lateral inhibitory learning. The model also produces an increase in the cortical representation of the skin region represented by the ICMS-site RF. ICMS is compared to artificial scotoma conditioning (Pettet & Gilbert, 1992) and retinal lesions (Darian-Smith & Gilbert, 1995), and it is suggested that lateral inhibitory learning may be a general principle of cortical plasticity.

Such units can produce a variety of useful behaviors, ranging from deterministic to binary stochastic to continuous stochastic. I show how ""slice sampling"" can be used for inference and learning in top-down networks of these units and demonstrate learning on two simple problems. ",0
"Title: Inductive Bias in Case-Based Reasoning Systems  
Abstract: In order to learn more about the behaviour of case-based reasoners as learning systems, we form-alise a simple case-based learner as a PAC learning algorithm, using the case-based representation hCB; i. We first consider a `naive' case-based learning algorithm CB1( H ) which learns by collecting all available cases into the case-base and which calculates similarity by counting the number of features on which two problem descriptions agree. We present results concerning the consistency of this learning algorithm and give some partial results regarding its sample complexity. We are able to characterise CB1( H ) as a `weak but general' learning algorithm. We then consider how the sample complexity of case-based learning can be reduced for specific classes of target concept by the application of inductive bias, or prior knowledge of the class of target concepts. Following recent work demonstrating how case-based learning can be improved by choosing a similarity measure appropriate to the concept being learnt, we define a second case-based learning `algorithm' CB2 which learns using the best possible similarity measure that might be inferred for the chosen target concept. While CB2 is not an executable learning strategy (since the chosen similarity measure is defined in terms of a priori knowledge of the actual target concept) it allows us to assess in the limit the maximum possible contribution of this approach to case-based learning. Also, in addition to illustrating the role of inductive bias, the definition of CB2 simplifies the general problem of establishing which functions might be represented in the form hCB; i. Reasoning about the case-based representation in this special case has therefore been a little more straight-forward than in the general case of CB1( H ), allowing more substantial results regarding representable functions and sample complexity to be presented for CB2. In assessing these results, we are forced to conclude that case-based learning is not the best approach to learning the chosen concept space (the space of monomial functions). We discuss, however, how our study has demonstrated, in the context of case-based learning, the operation of concepts well known in machine learning such as inductive bias and the trade-off between computational complexity and sample complexity.

"Title: Selection for Wandering Behavior in a Small Robot  
Abstract: We have evolved artificial neural networks to control the wandering behavior of small robots. The task was to touch as many squares in a grid as possible during a fixed period of time. A number of the simulated robots were embodied in small Lego (Trademark) robot, controlled by a Motorola (Trademark) 6811 processor; and their performance was compared to the simulations. We observed that: (a) evolution was an effective means to program control; (b) progress was characterized by sharply stepped periods of improvement, separated by periods of stasis that corresponded to levels of behavioral/computational complexity; and (c) the simulated and realized robots behaved quite similarly, the realized robots in some cases outperforming the simulated ones. Introducing random noise to the simulations improved the fit somewhat (from 0.73 to 0.79). Hybrid simulated/embodied selection regimes for evolutionary robots are discussed.

"Title: More Efficient Windowing  
Abstract: Windowing has been proposed as a procedure for efficient memory use in the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm. However, previous work has shown that windowing may often lead to a decrease in performance. In this work, we try to argue that separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms are more appropriate for windowing than divide-and-conquer algorithms, because they learn rules independently and are less susceptible to changes in class distributions. In particular, we will present a new windowing algorithm that achieves additional gains in efficiency by exploiting this property of separate-and-conquer algorithms. While the presented algorithm is only suitable for redundant, noise-free data sets, we will also briefly discuss the problem of noisy data in windowing and present some preliminary ideas how it might be solved with an extension of the algorithm introduced in this paper.

We have developed encoding and search methods for discovering linear causal models. The initial experimental results presented in this paper show that the MML induction approach can recover causal models from generated data which are quite accurate reflections of the original models; our results compare favorably with those of the TETRAD II program of Spirtes et al. [25] even when their algorithm is supplied with prior temporal information and MML is not. ",0
"Title: Adapting Abstract Knowledge  
Abstract: For a case-based reasoner to use its knowledge flexibly, it must be equipped with a powerful case adapter. A case-based reasoner can only cope with variation in the form of the problems it is given to the extent that its cases in memory can be efficiently adapted to fit a wide range of new situations. In this paper, we address the task of adapting abstract knowledge about planning to fit specific planning situations. First we show that adapting abstract cases requires reconciling incommensurate representations of planning situations. Next, we describe a representation system, a memory organization, and an adaptation process tailored to this requirement. Our approach is implemented in brainstormer, a planner that takes abstract advice. ","Title: Classification by Pairwise Coupling

"Title: Automatic Design of Cellular Neural Networks by means of Genetic Algorithms: Finding a Feature Detector
Abstract: This paper aims to examine the use of genetic algorithms to optimize subsystems of cellular neural network architectures. The application at hand is character recognition: the aim is to evolve an optimal feature detector in order to aid a conventional classifier network to generalize across different fonts. To this end, a performance function and a genetic encoding for a feature detector are presented. An experiment is described where an optimal feature detector is indeed found by the genetic algorithm. We are interested in the application of cellular neural networks in computer vision. Genetic algorithms (GA's) [1-3] can serve to optimize the design of cellular neural networks. Although the design of the global architecture of the system could still be done by human insight, we propose that specific sub-modules of the system are best optimized using one or other optimization method. GAs are a good candidate to fulfill this optimization role, as they are well suited to problems where the objective function is a complex function of many parameters. The specific problem we want to investigate is one of character recognition. More specifically, we would like to use the GA to find optimal feature detectors to be used in the recognition of digits . ","Title: A Generalized Permutation Approach to Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Algorithms  
Abstract: In order to sequence the tasks of a job shop problem (JSP) on a number of machines related to the technological machine order of jobs, a new representation technique mathematically known as ""permutation with repetition"" is presented. The main advantage of this single chromosome representation is in analogy to the permutation scheme of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that it cannot produce illegal sets of operation sequences (infeasible symbolic solutions). As a consequence of the representation scheme a new crossover operator preserving the initial scheme structure of permutations with repetition will be sketched. Its behavior is similar to the well known Order-Crossover for simple permutation schemes. Actually the GOX operator for permutations with repetition arises from a Generalisation of OX. Computational experiments show, that GOX passes the information from a couple of parent solutions efficiently to offspring solutions. Together, the new representation and GOX support the cooperative aspect of the genetic search for scheduling problems strongly. ",0
"Title: On Learning Multiple Descriptions of a Concept  
Abstract: In sparse data environments, greater classification accuracy can be achieved by learning several concept descriptions of the data and combining their classifications. Stochastic search is a general tool which can be used to generate many good concept descriptions (rule sets) for each class in the data. Bayesian probability theory offers an optimal strategy for combining classifications of the individual concept descriptions, and here we use an approximation of that theory. This strategy is most useful when additional data is difficult to obtain and every increase in classification accuracy is important. The primary result of this paper is that multiple concept descriptions are particularly helpful in ""flat"" hypothesis spaces in which there are many equally good ways to grow a rule, each having similar gain. Another result is experimental evidence that learning multiple rule sets yields more accurate classifications than learning multiple rules for some domains. To demonstrate these behaviors, we learn multiple concept descriptions by adapting HYDRA, a noise-tolerant relational learning algorithm.

"Title: MBP on T0: mixing floating- and fixed-point formats in BP learning  
Abstract: We examine the efficient implementation of back prop type algorithms on T0 [4], a vector processor with a fixed point engine, designed for neural network simulation. A matrix formulation of back prop, Matrix Back Prop [1], has been shown to be very efficient on some RISCs [2]. Using Matrix Back Prop, we achieve an asymptotically optimal performance on T0 (about 0.8 GOPS) for both forward and backward phases, which is not possible with the standard on-line method. Since high efficiency is futile if convergence is poor (due to the use of fixed point arithmetic), we use a mixture of fixed and floating point operations. The key observation is that the precision of fixed point is sufficient for good convergence, if the range is appropriately chosen. Though the most expensive computations are implemented in fixed point, we achieve a rate of convergence that is comparable to the floating point version. The time taken for conversion between fixed and floating point is also shown to be reasonable. ","Title: The Challenge of Revising an Impure Theory  
Abstract: A pure rule-based program will return a set of answers to each query; and will return the same answer set even if its rules are re-ordered. However, an impure program, which includes the Prolog cut ""!"" and not() operators, can return different answers if the rules are re-ordered. There are also many reasoning systems that return only the first answer found for each query; these first answers, too, depend on the rule order, even in pure rule-based systems. A theory revision algorithm, seeking a revised rule-base whose expected accuracy, over the distribution of queries, is optimal, should therefore consider modifying the order of the rules. This paper first shows that a polynomial number of training ""labeled queries"" (each a query coupled with its correct answer) provides the distribution information necessary to identify the optimal ordering. It then proves, however, that the task of determining which ordering is optimal, once given this information, is intractable even in trivial situations; e.g., even if each query is an atomic literal, we are seeking only a ""perfect"" theory, and the rule base is propositional. We also prove that this task is not even approximable: Unless P = N P , no polynomial time algorithm can produce an ordering of an n-rule theory whose accuracy is within n fl of optimal, for some fl &gt; 0. We also prove similar hardness, and non-approximatability, results for the related tasks of determining, in these impure contexts, (1) the optimal ordering of the antecedents; (2) the optimal set of rules to add or (3) to delete; and (4) the optimal priority values for a set of defaults.

Abstract: When specializing a recursive predicate in order to exclude a set of negative examples without excluding a set of positive examples, it may not be possible to specialize or remove any of the clauses in a refutation of a negative example without excluding any positive exam ples. A previously proposed solution to this problem is to apply program transformation in order to obtain non-recursive target predicates from recursive ones. However, the application of this method prevents recursive specializations from being found. In this work, we present the algorithm spectre ii which is not limited to specializing non-recursive predicates. The key idea upon which the algorithm is based is that it is not enough to specialize or remove clauses in refutations of negative examples in order to obtain correct specializations, but it is sometimes necessary to specialize clauses that appear only in refutations of positive examples. In contrast to its predecessor spectre, the new algorithm is not limited to specializing clauses defining one predicate only, but may specialize clauses defining multiple predicates. Furthermore, the positive and negative examples are no longer required to be instances of the same predicate. It is proven that the algorithm produces a correct specialization when all positive examples are logical consequences of the original program, there is a finite number of derivations of positive and negative examples and when no positive and negative examples have the same sequence of input clauses in their refutations.",0
"Title: Parametric Design Problem Solving  
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to understand what is involved in parametric design problem solving. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we formulate a generic model of parametric design problem solving. We then redescribe a number of problem solving methods in terms of the proposed generic model and we show that such a redescription enables us to provide a more precise account of the different competence behaviours expressed by the methods in Design is about constructing artifacts. This means that, broadly speaking, any design process is 'creative', in the sense that a design process produces a 'new solution', as opposed to selecting a solution from a predefined set. While recognizing the essential creative elements present in any design process, researchers, e.g. Gero (1990), restrict the use of the term 'creative design' to those design applications where the design elements of the target artifact cannot be selected from a predefined set. For instance, when designing a new car model it is normally the case that some design innovations are included, which were not present in previous car designs. In other words it is not (always) possible to characterise the process of designing a new car as one in which components are assembled and configured from a predefined set. Nevertheless, in a large number of real-world applications it is possible to assume that the target artifact is going to be designed in terms of predefined design elements. In such a scenario the design process consists of assembling and configuring these preexisting design elements in a way which satisfies the design requirements and constraints, and approximates some, typically cost-related, optimization criterion. This class of design tasks takes the name of configuration design (Stefik, 1995). In many cases, typically when the problem in hand does not exhibit complex spatial requirements and all possible solutions adhere to a common solution template, it is possible to simplify the configuration design problem even further, by modelling the target artifact as a set of parameters and characterizing design problem solving as the process of assigning values to parameters in accordance with the given design requirements, constraints, and optimization criterion. When this assumption is true for a particular task, we say that this is a parametric design task. The VT application (Marcus et al., 1988; Yost and Rothenfluh, 1996) provides a well-known example of a parametric design task. The aim of this paper is to understand what is involved in parametric design problem solving. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we produce a generic model of parametric design problem solving, characterised at the knowledge level, which generalizes from existing methods for parametric design. We then redescribe a number of problem solving methods in terms of the question.","Title: Adaptive Mixtures of Probabilistic Transducers

Theoretical analysis and comparative simulations indicate that the learning algorithm tracks the best transducer from an arbitrarily large (possibly infinite) pool of models. We also present an application of the model for inducing a noun phrase recognizer.",0
"Title: MLC A Machine Learning Library in C  
Abstract: We present MLC ++ , a library of C ++ classes and tools for supervised Machine Learning. While MLC ++ provides general learning algorithms that can be used by end users, the main objective is to provide researchers and experts with a wide variety of tools that can accelerate algorithm development, increase software reliability, provide comparison tools, and display information visually. More than just a collection of existing algorithms, MLC ++ is an attempt to extract commonalities of algorithms and decompose them for a unified view that is simple, coherent, and extensible. In this paper we discuss the problems MLC ++ aims to solve, the design of MLC ++ , and the current functionality. ","Title: Specialization of Logic Programs by Pruning SLD-Trees  
Abstract: program w.r.t. positive and negative examples can be viewed as the problem of pruning an SLD-tree such that all refutations of negative examples and no refutations of positive examples are excluded. It is shown that the actual pruning can be performed by applying unfolding and clause removal. The algorithm spectre is presented, which is based on this idea. The input to the algorithm is, besides a logic program and positive and negative examples, a computation rule, which determines the shape of the SLD-tree that is to be pruned. It is shown that the generality of the resulting specialization is dependent on the computation rule, and experimental results are presented from using three different computation rules. The experiments indicate that the computation rule should be formulated so that the number of applications of unfolding is kept as low as possible. The algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method, is also compared with a covering algorithm. The experiments show that a higher predictive accuracy can be achieved if the focus is on discriminating positive from negative examples rather than on achieving a high coverage of positive examples only.

"Title: Belief Revision in Probability Theory  
Abstract: In a probability-based reasoning system, Bayes' theorem and its variations are often used to revise the system's beliefs. However, if the explicit conditions and the implicit conditions of probability assignments are properly distinguished, it follows that Bayes' theorem is not a generally applicable revision rule. Upon properly distinguishing belief revision from belief updating, we see that Jeffrey's rule and its variations are not revision rules, either. Without these distinctions, the limitation of the Bayesian approach is often ignored or underestimated. Revision, in its general form, cannot be done in the Bayesian approach, because a probability distribution function alone does not contain the information needed by the operation.","Title: %A L.

","Title: Growing Cell Structures A Self-organizing Network for Unsupervised and Supervised Learning  
Abstract: We present a new self-organizing neural network model having two variants. The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches, e.g., the Kohonen feature map, is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process which also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method which results from the combination of the abovementioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible in contrast to earlier approaches toperform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks which generalize very well. Results on the two-spirals benchmark and a vowel classification problem are presented which are better than any results previously published. fl submitted for publication",0
"Title: Statistical Biases in Backpropagation Learning  Keywords: Cognitive Science, Pattern recognition  
Abstract: The paper investigates the statistical effects which may need to be exploited in supervised learning. It notes that these effects can be classified according to their conditionality and their order and proposes that learning algorithms will typically have some form of bias towards particular classes of effect. It presents the results of an empirical study of the statistical bias of backpropagation. The study involved applying the algorithm to a wide range of learning problems using a variety of different internal architectures. The results of the study revealed that backpropagation has a very specific bias in the general direction of statistical rather than relational effects. The paper shows how the existence of this bias effectively constitutes a weakness in the algorithm's ability to discount noise. ","Title: ICML-96 Workshop ""Learning in context-sensitive domains"" Bari, Italy. Dynamically Adjusting Concepts to Accommodate Changing Contexts  
Abstract: In concept learning, objects in a domain are grouped together based on similarity as determined by the attributes used to describe them. Existing concept learners require that this set of attributes be known in advance and presented in entirety before learning begins. Additionally, most systems do not possess mechanisms for altering the attribute set after concepts have been learned. Consequently, a veridical attribute set relevant to the task for which the concepts are to be used must be supplied at the onset of learning, and in turn, the usefulness of the concepts is limited to the task for which the attributes were originally selected. In order to efficiently accommodate changing contexts, a concept learner must be able to alter the set of descriptors without discarding its prior knowledge of the domain. We introduce the notion of attribute-incrementation, the dynamic modification of the attribute set used to describe instances in a problem domain. We have implemented the capability in a concept learning system that has been evaluated along several dimensions using an existing concept formation system for com parison.",0
"Title: Refining Conversational Case Libraries  
Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) shells (e.g., Inference's CBR Express) are commercially successful tools for supporting the development of help desk and related applications. In contrast to rule-based expert systems, they capture knowledge as cases rather than more problematic rules, and they can be incrementally extended. However, rather than eliminate the knowledge engineering bottleneck, they refocus it on case engineering, the task of carefully authoring cases according to library design guidelines to ensure good performance. Designing complex libraries according to these guidelines is difficult; software is needed to assist users with case authoring. We describe an approach for revising case libraries according to design guidelines, its implementation in Clire, and empirical results showing that, under some conditions, this approach can improve conversational CBR performance.","Title: A Delay Damage Model Selection Algorithm for NARX Neural Networks  
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks have become popular models for system identification and time series prediction. NARX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive models with eXogenous inputs) neural network models are a popular subclass of recurrent networks and have been used in many applications. Though embedded memory can be found in all recurrent network models, it is particularly prominent in NARX models. We show that using intelligent memory order selection through pruning and good initial heuristics significantly improves the generalization and predictive performance of these nonlinear systems on problems as diverse as grammatical inference and time series prediction.

Abstract: We describe SFOIL, a descendant of FOIL that uses the advanced stochastic search heuristic, and its application in learning to compose the two-voice counterpoint. The application required learning a 4-ary relation from more than 20.000 training instances. SFOIL is able to efficiently deal with this learning task which is to our knowledge one of the most complex learning task solved by an ILP system. This demonstrates that ILP systems can scale up to real databases and that top-down ILP systems that use the covering approach and advanced search strategies are appropriate for knowledge discovery in databases and are promising for further investigation.

Some of the most intriguing recent work has focused on uniform crossover, which involves on the average L/2 crossover points for strings of length L. Theoretical results suggest that, from the view of hyperplane sampling disruption, uniform crossover has few redeeming features. However, a growing body of experimental evidence suggests otherwise. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these opposing views of uniform crossover and present a framework for understanding its virtues.",0

He is now with the Brain Information Processing Group, Frontier Research Program, RIKEN, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-01, Japan Abstract The performance of neural network simulations is often reported in terms of the mean and standard deviation of a number of simulations performed with different starting conditions. However, in many cases, the distribution of the individual results does not approximate a Gaussian distribution, may not be symmetric, and may be multimodal. We present the distribution of results for practical problems and show that assuming Gaussian distributions can significantly affect the interpretation of results, especially those of comparison studies. For a controlled task which we consider, we find that the distribution of performance is skewed towards better performance for smoother target functions and skewed towards worse performance ","Title: On the Semantics of Belief Revision Systems  
Abstract: We consider belief revision operators that satisfy the Alchourron-Gardenfors-Makinson postulates, and present an epistemic logic in which, for any such revision operator, the result of a revision can be described by a sentence in the logic. In our logic, the fact that the agent's set of beliefs is is represented by the sentence O, where O is Levesque's `only know' operator. Intuitively, O is read as ` is all that is believed.' The fact that the agent believes is represented by the sentence B , read in the usual way as ` is believed'. The connective represents update as defined by Katsuno and Mendelzon. The revised beliefs are represented by the sentence O B . We show that for every revision operator that satisfies the AGM postulates, there is a model for our epistemic logic such that the beliefs implied by the sentence O B in this model correspond exactly to the sentences implied by the theory that results from revising by . This means that reasoning about changes in the agent's beliefs reduces to model checking of certain epistemic sentences. The negative result in the paper is that this type of formal account of revision cannot be extended to the situation where the agent is able to reason about its beliefs. A fully introspective agent cannot use our construction to reason about the results of its own revisions, on pain of triviality. ",0
"Title: A Comparison of Action Selection Learning Methods  
Abstract: Our goal is to develop a hybrid cognitive model of how humans acquire skills on complex cognitive tasks. We are pursuing this goal by designing hybrid computational architectures for the NRL Navigation task, which requires competent senso-rimotor coordination. In this paper, we empirically compare two methods for control knowledge acquisition (reinforcement learning and a novel variant of action models), as well as a hybrid of these methods, with human learning on this task. Our results indicate that the performance of our action models approach more closely approximates the rate of human learning on the task than does reinforcement learning or the hybrid. We also experimentally explore the impact of background knowledge on system performance. By adding knowledge used by the action models system to the benchmark reinforcement learner, we elevate its performance above that of the action models system. ","Title: Testing for Gaussianity and Non Linearity in the sustained portion of musical sounds.  
Abstract: Higher order spectra of a signal contain information about the non Gaussian and non Linear properties of the system that created it. Since the non linearity in musical signal usually originate in the excitation signal while the linear spectral characteristics are attributed to the resonant chambers, we discard the spectral information by looking at the higher order statistical properties of the residual signal, i.e. the estimated input signal obtained by inverse filtering of the sound. In the current paper we show that the skewness and kurtosis values of the residual could be used for characterization of such important sound properties as belonging to families of strings, woodwind and brass instrumental timbres. The skewness parameter is shown to be closely related to the bicoherence function calculated over the original signal and as such it is succinct to an interpretation as statistical test for the signal conforming to a linear non Gaussian model. The above results are compared to the Hinich bispectral tests for Gaussianity and non Linearity of time series and exhibit a similar classification results. Finally, regarding the higher order statistics of a signal as a feature vector, a statistical distance measure for the cumulant space is suggested. ",0
"Title: Bayesian Mixture Modeling by Monte Carlo Simulation  
Abstract: It is shown that Bayesian inference from data modeled by a mixture distribution can feasibly be performed via Monte Carlo simulation. This method exhibits the true Bayesian predictive distribution, implicitly integrating over the entire underlying parameter space. An infinite number of mixture components can be accommodated without difficulty, using a prior distribution for mixing proportions that selects a reasonable subset of components to explain any finite training set. The need to decide on a ""correct"" number of components is thereby avoided. The feasibility of the method is shown empirically for a simple classification task. ","Title: Learning sorting and decision trees with POMDPs  
Abstract: pomdps are general models of sequential decisions in which both actions and observations can be probabilistic. Many problems of interest can be formulated as pomdps, yet the use of pomdps has been limited by the lack of effective algorithms. Recently this has started to change and a number of problems such as robot navigation and planning are beginning to be formulated and solved as pomdps. The advantage of the pomdp approach is its clean semantics and its ability to produce principled solutions that integrate physical and information gathering actions. In this paper we pursue this approach in the context of two learning tasks: learning to sort a vector of numbers and learning decision trees from data. Both problems are formulated as pomdps and solved by a general pomdp algorithm. The main lessons and results are that 1) the use of suitable heuristics and representations allows for the solution of sorting and classification pomdps of non-trivial sizes, 2) the quality of the resulting solutions are competitive with the best algorithms, and 3) problematic aspects in decision tree learning such as test and mis-classification costs, noisy tests, and missing values are naturally accommodated.",0
"Title: Efficient Instruction Scheduling Using Finite State Automata  
Abstract: Modern compilers employ sophisticated instruction scheduling techniques to shorten the number of cycles taken to execute the instruction stream. In addition to correctness, the instruction scheduler must also ensure that hardware resources are not oversubscribed in any cycle. For a contemporary processor implementation with multiple pipelines and complex resource usage restrictions, this is not an easy task. The complexity involved in reasoning about such resource hazards is one of the primary factors that constrain the instruction scheduler from performing many aggressive transformations. For example, the ability to do code motion or instruction replacement in the middle of an already scheduled block would be a very powerful transformation if it could be performed efficiently. We extend a technique for detecting pipeline resource hazards based on finite state automata, to support the efficient implementation of such transformations that are essential for aggressive instruction scheduling beyond basic blocks. Although similar code transformations can be supported by other schemes such as reservation tables, our scheme is superior in terms of space and time. A global instruction scheduler that used these techniques was implemented in the KSR compiler. ","Title: 28 Learning Bayesian Networks Using Feature Selection  
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel enhancement for learning Bayesian networks with a bias for small, high-predictive-accuracy networks. The new approach selects a subset of features that maximizes predictive accuracy prior to the network learning phase. We examine explicitly the effects of two aspects of the algorithm, feature selection and node ordering. Our approach generates networks that are computationally simpler to evaluate and display predictive accuracy comparable Bayesian networks are being increasingly recognized as an important representation for probabilistic reasoning. For many domains, the need to specify the probability distributions for a Bayesian network is considerable, and learning these probabilities from data using an algorithm like K2 [Cooper92] could alleviate such specification difficulties. We describe an extension to the Bayesian network learning approaches introduced in K2. Our goal is to construct networks that are simpler to evaluate but still have high predictive accuracy relative to networks that model all features. Rather than use all database features (or attributes) for constructing the network, we select a subset of features that maximize the predictive accuracy of the network. Then the learning process uses only the selected features as nodes in learning the Bayesian network. We examine explicitly the effects of two aspects of the algorithm: (a) feature selection, and (b) node ordering. Our experimental results verify that this approach generates networks that are compu-tationally simpler to evaluate and display predictive accuracy comparable to the predictive accuracy of Bayesian networks that model all features. Our results, similar to those observed by other studies of feature selection in learning [Caruana94, John94, Langley94a, Langley94b], demonstrate that feature selection provides comparable predictive accuracy using smaller networks. For example, by selecting as few as 18% of the features for the to that of Bayesian networks which model all attributes.",0

Abstract: In a recent paper, Friedman, Geiger, and Goldszmidt [8] introduced a classifier based on Bayesian networks, called Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), that outperforms naive Bayes and performs competitively with C4.5 and other state-of-the-art methods. This classifier has several advantages including robustness and polynomial computational complexity. One limitation of the TAN classifier is that it applies only to discrete attributes, and thus, continuous attributes must be prediscretized. In this paper, we extend TAN to deal with continuous attributes directly via parametric (e.g., Gaussians) and semiparametric (e.g., mixture of Gaussians) conditional probabilities. The result is a classifier that can represent and combine both discrete and continuous attributes. In addition, we propose a new method that takes advantage of the modeling language of Bayesian networks in order to represent attributes both in discrete and continuous form simultaneously, and use both versions in the classification. This automates the process of deciding which form of the attribute is most relevant to the classification task. It also avoids the commitment to either a discretized or a (semi)parametric form, since different attributes may correlate better with one version or the other. Our empirical results show that this latter method usually achieves classification performance that is as good as or better than either the purely discrete or the purely continuous TAN models.",0
"Title: Computing Nonparametric Hierarchical Models  
Abstract: Bayesian models involving Dirichlet process mixtures are at the heart of the modern nonparametric Bayesian movement. Much of the rapid development of these models in the last decade has been a direct result of advances in simulation-based computational methods. Some of the very early work in this area, circa 1988-1991, focused on the use of such nonparametric ideas and models in applications of otherwise standard hierarchical models. This chapter provides some historical review and perspective on these developments, with a prime focus on the use and integration of such nonparametric ideas in hierarchical models. We illustrate the ease with which the strict parametric assumptions common to most standard Bayesian hierarchical models can be relaxed to incorporate uncertainties about functional forms using Dirichlet process components, partly enabled by the approach to computation using MCMC methods. The resulting methology is illustrated with two examples taken from an unpublished 1992 report on the topic.","Title: Multi-criteria reinforcement learning

"Title: Intelligent Model Selection for Hillclimbing Search in Computer-Aided Design  
Abstract: Models of physical systems can differ according to computational cost, accuracy and precision, among other things. Depending on the problem solving task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is novel in that we are developing model selection techniques specifically suited to computer-aided de sign. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design should be chosen in light of the design decisions they are required to support. We have developed a technique called ""Gradient Magnitude Model Selection"" (GMMS), which embodies this principle. GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing search process. It selects the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimb-ing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS makes the design process faster than it would be if the most expensive model were used for all design evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality of the resulting design. ","Title: An Optimum Decision Rule for Pattern Recognition

Despite theoretical analysis, however, it appears difficult to predict when a particular crossover form will be optimal for a given problem.

"Title: The Case for Graph-Structured Representations  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific pieces of experience, the reasoner's or another's, that can be used to solve problems. We use the term ""graph-structured"" for representations that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case, and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some logic. We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations efficiently. We make a ""case-based argument"" using examples from two systems, chiron and caper, to show how a graph-structured representation supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, imple mented in caper.","Title: Decimatable Boltzmann Machines vs. Gibbs Sampling

","Title: Modeling the Evolution of Motivation  
Abstract: In order for learning to improve the adaptiveness of an animal's behavior and thus direct evolution in the way Baldwin suggested, the learning mechanism must incorporate an innate evaluation of how the animal's actions influence its reproductive fitness. For example, many circumstances that damage an animal, or otherwise reduce its fitness are painful and tend to be avoided. We refer to the mechanism by which an animal evaluates the fitness consequences of its actions as a ""motivation system,"" and argue that such a system must evolve along with the behaviors it evaluates. We describe simulations of the evolution of populations of agents instantiating a number of different architectures for generating action and learning, in worlds of differing complexity. We find that in some cases, members of the populations evolve motivation systems that are accurate enough to direct learning so as to increase the fitness of the actions the agents perform. Furthermore, the motivation systems tend to incorporate systematic distortions in their representations of the worlds they inhabit; these distortions can increase the adaptiveness of the behavior generated.

"Title: Building Intelligent Agents for Web-Based Tasks: A Theory-Refinement Approach  
Abstract: We present and evaluate an infrastructure with which to rapidly and easily build intelligent software agents for Web-based tasks. Our design is centered around two basic functions: ScoreThis-Link and ScoreThisPage. If given highly accurate such functions, standard heuristic search would lead to efficient retrieval of useful information. Our approach allows users to tailor our system's behavior by providing approximate advice about the above functions. This advice is mapped into neural network implementations of the two functions. Subsequent reinforcements from the Web (e.g., dead links) and any ratings of retrieved pages that the user wishes to provide are, respectively, used to refine the link- and page-scoring functions. Hence, our agent architecture provides an appealing middle ground between nonadaptive ""agent"" programming languages and systems that solely learn user preferences from the user's ratings of pages. We present a case study where we provide some simple advice and specialize our general-purpose system into a ""home-page finder"". An empirical study demonstrates that our approach leads to a more effective home-page finder than that of a leading commercial Web search engine.

Abstract: We present new algorithms for reinforcement learning and prove that they have polynomial bounds on the resources required to achieve near-optimal return in general Markov decision processes. After observing that the number of actions required to approach the optimal return is lower bounded by the mixing time T of the optimal policy (in the undiscounted case) or by the horizon time T (in the discounted case), we then give algorithms requiring a number of actions and total computation time that are only polynomial in T and the number of states, for both the undiscounted and discounted cases. An interesting aspect of our algorithms is their explicit handling of the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off. These are the first results in the reinforcement learning literature giving algorithms that provably converge to near-optimal performance in polynomial time for general Markov decision processes. ",0
"Title: A Simpler Look at Consistency  
Abstract: One of the major goals of most early concept learners was to find hypotheses that were perfectly consistent with the training data. It was believed that this goal would indirectly achieve a high degree of predictive accuracy on a set of test data. Later research has partially disproved this belief. However, the issue of consistency has not yet been resolved completely. We examine the issue of consistency from a new perspective. To avoid overfitting the training data, a considerable number of current systems have sacrificed the goal of learning hypotheses that are perfectly consistent with the training instances by setting a goal of hypothesis simplicity (Occam's razor). Instead of using simplicity as a goal, we have developed a novel approach that addresses consistency directly. In other words, our concept learner has the explicit goal of selecting the most appropriate degree of consistency with the training data. We begin this paper by exploring concept learning with less than perfect consistency. Next, we describe a system that can adapt its degree of consistency in response to feedback about predictive accuracy on test data. Finally, we present the results of initial experiments that begin to address the question of how tightly hypotheses should fit the training data for different problems. ","Title: Massively Parallel Support for Case-based Planning  
Abstract: In case-based planning (CBP), previously generated plans are stored as cases in memory and can be reused to solve similar planning problems in the future. CBP can save considerable time over planning from scratch (generative planning), thus offering a potential (heuristic) mechanism for handling intractable problems. One drawback of CBP systems has been the need for a highly structured memory that requires significant domain engineering and complex memory indexing schemes to enable efficient case retrieval. In contrast, our CBP system, CaPER, is based on a massively parallel frame-based AI language and can do extremely fast retrieval of complex cases from a large, unindexed memory. The ability to do fast, frequent retrievals has many advantages: indexing is unnecessary; very large casebases can be used; and memory can be probed in numerous alternate ways, allowing more specific retrieval of stored plans that better fit a target problem with less adaptation. fl Preliminary version of an article appearing in IEEE Expert, February 1994, pp. 8-14.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for learning logic programs without explicit negative examples by exploiting an assumption of output completeness. A mode declaration is supplied for the target predicate and each training input is assumed to be accompanied by all of its legal outputs. Any other outputs generated by an incomplete program implicitly represent negative examples; however, large numbers of ground negative examples never need to be generated. This method has been incorporated into two ILP systems, Chillin and IFoil, both of which use intensional background knowledge. Tests on two natural language acquisition tasks, case-role mapping and past-tense learning, illustrate the advantages of the approach. ",0

","Title: Genetic Programming Exploratory Power and the Discovery of Functions  
Abstract: Hierarchical genetic programming (HGP) approaches rely on the discovery, modification, and use of new functions to accelerate evolution. This paper provides a qualitative explanation of the improved behavior of HGP, based on an analysis of the evolution process from the dual perspective of diversity and causality. From a static point of view, the use of an HGP approach enables the manipulation of a population of higher diversity programs. Higher diversity increases the exploratory ability of the genetic search process, as demonstrated by theoretical and experimental fitness distributions and expanded structural complexity of individuals. From a dynamic point of view, an analysis of the causality of the crossover operator suggests that HGP discovers and exploits useful structures in a bottom-up, hierarchical manner. Diversity and causality are complementary, affecting exploration and exploitation in genetic search. Unlike other machine learning techniques that need extra machinery to control the tradeoff between them, HGP automatically trades off exploration and exploitation. ",0
"Title: An Optimal Weighting Criterion of Case Indexing for Both Numeric and Symbolic Attributes  
Abstract: Indexing of cases is an important topic for Memory-Based Reasoning(MBR). One key problem is how to assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some other weighting methods. The results also indicate that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data. ","Title: Rational Belief Revision (Preliminary Report)  
Abstract: Theories of rational belief revision recently proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, Makin-son, and Nebel illuminate many important issues but impose unnecessarily strong standards for correct revisions and make strong assumptions about what information is available to guide revisions. We reconstruct these theories according to an economic standard of rationality in which preferences are used to select among alternative possible revisions. By permitting multiple partial specifications of preferences in ways closely related to preference-based nonmonotonic logics, the reconstructed theory employs information closer to that available in practice and offers more flexible ways of selecting revisions. We formally compare this new conception of rational belief revision with the original theories, adapt results about universal default theories to prove that there is unlikely to be any universal method of rational belief revision, and examine formally how different limitations on rationality affect belief revision.",0
"Title: Using a Distance Metric on Genetic Programs to Understand Genetic Operators  
Abstract: I describe a distance metric called ""edit"" distance which quantifies the syntactic difference between two genetic programs. In the context of one specific problem, the 6 bit multiplexor, I use the metric to analyze the amount of new material introduced by different crossover operators, the difference among the best individuals of a population and the difference among the best individuals and the rest of the population. The relationships between these data and run performance are imprecise but they are sufficiently interesting to encourage encourage further investigation into the use of edit distance.","Title: The Royal Road for Genetic Algorithms: Fitness Landscapes and GA Performance  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) play a major role in many artificial-life systems, but there is often little detailed understanding of why the GA performs as it does, and little theoretical basis on which to characterize the types of fitness landscapes that lead to successful GA performance. In this paper we propose a strategy for addressing these issues. Our strategy consists of defining a set of features of fitness landscapes that are particularly relevant to the GA, and experimentally studying how various configurations of these features affect the GA's performance along a number of dimensions. In this paper we informally describe an initial set of proposed feature classes, describe in detail one such class (""Royal Road"" functions), and present some initial experimental results concerning the role of crossover and ""building blocks"" on landscapes constructed from features of this class.",0
"Title: Evolving Turing-Complete Programs for a Register Machine with Self-modifying Code  
Abstract: The majority of commercial computers today are register machines of von Neumann type. We have developed a method to evolve Turing-complete programs for a register machine. The described implementation enables the use of most program constructs, such as arithmetic operators, large indexed memory, automatic decomposition into subfunctions and subroutines (ADFs), conditional constructs i.e. if-then-else, jumps, loop structures, recursion, protected functions, string and list functions. Any C-function can be compiled and linked into the function set of the system. The use of register machine language allows us to work at the lowest level of binary machine code without any interpreting steps. In a von Neumann machine, programs and data reside in the same memory and the genetic operators can thus directly manipulate the binary machine code in memory. The genetic operators themselves are written in C-language but they modify individuals in binary representation. The result is an execution speed enhancement of up to 100 times compared to an interpreting C-language implementation, and up to 2000 times compared to a LISP implementation. The use of binary machine code demands a very compact coding of about one byte per node in the individual. The resulting evolved programs are disassembled into C-modules and can be incorporated into a conventional software development environment. The low memory requirements and the significant speed enhancement of this technique could be of use when applying genetic programming to new application areas, platforms and research domains.

"Title: Neural net architectures for temporal sequence processing  
Abstract: I present a general taxonomy of neural net architectures for processing time-varying patterns. This taxonomy subsumes many existing architectures in the literature, and points to several promising architectures that have yet to be examined. Any architecture that processes time-varying patterns requires two conceptually distinct components: a short-term memory that holds on to relevant past events and an associator that uses the short-term memory to classify or predict. My taxonomy is based on a characterization of short-term memory models along the dimensions of form, content, and adaptability. Experiments on predicting future values of a financial time series (US dollar-Swiss franc exchange rates) are presented using several alternative memory models. The results of these experiments serve as a baseline against which more sophisticated architectures can be compared. Neural networks have proven to be a promising alternative to traditional techniques for nonlinear temporal prediction tasks (e.g., Curtiss, Brandemuehl, & Kreider, 1992; Lapedes & Farber, 1987; Weigend, Huberman, & Rumelhart, 1992). However, temporal prediction is a particularly challenging problem because conventional neural net architectures and algorithms are not well suited for patterns that vary over time. The prototypical use of neural nets is in structural pattern recognition. In such a task, a collection of features|visual, semantic, or otherwise|is presented to a network and the network must categorize the input feature pattern as belonging to one or more classes. For example, a network might be trained to classify animal species based on a set of attributes describing living creatures such as ""has tail"", ""lives in water"", or ""is carnivorous""; or a network could be trained to recognize visual patterns over a two-dimensional pixel array as a letter in fA; B; . . . ; Zg. In such tasks, the network is presented with all relevant information simultaneously. In contrast, temporal pattern recognition involves processing of patterns that evolve over time. The appropriate response at a particular point in time depends not only on the current input, but potentially all previous inputs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the basic framework for a temporal prediction problem. I assume that time is quantized into discrete steps, a sensible assumption because many time series of interest are intrinsically discrete, and continuous series can be sampled at a fixed interval. The input at time t is denoted x(t). For univariate series, this input ","Title: An Optimal Weighting Criterion of Case Indexing for Both Numeric and Symbolic Attributes  
Abstract: A General Result on the Stabilization of Linear Systems Using Bounded Controls 1 ABSTRACT We present two constructions of controllers that globally stabilize linear systems subject to control saturation. We allow essentially arbitrary saturation functions. The only conditions imposed on the system are the obvious necessary ones, namely that no eigenvalues of the uncontrolled system have positive real part and that the standard stabilizability rank condition hold. One of the constructions is in terms of a ""neural-network type"" one-hidden layer architecture, while the other one is in terms of cascades of linear maps and saturations. ",0
"Title: Mapping Bayesian Networks to Boltzmann Machines  
Abstract: We study the task of tnding a maximal a posteriori (MAP) instantiation of Bayesian network variables, given a partial value assignment as an initial constraint. This problem is known to be NP-hard, so we concentrate on a stochastic approximation algorithm, simulated annealing. This stochastic algorithm can be realized as a sequential process on the set of Bayesian network variables, where only one variable is allowed to change at a time. Consequently, the method can become impractically slow as the number of variables increases. We present a method for mapping a given Bayesian network to a massively parallel Bolztmann machine neural network architecture, in the sense that instead of using the normal sequential simulated annealing algorithm, we can use a massively parallel stochastic process on the Boltzmann machine architecture. The neural network updating process provably converges to a state which solves a given MAP task.","Title: Machine Learning, 22(1/2/3):95-121, 1996. On the Worst-case Analysis of Temporal-difference Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: We study the behavior of a family of learning algorithms based on Sutton's method of temporal differences. In our on-line learning framework, learning takes place in a sequence of trials, and the goal of the learning algorithm is to estimate a discounted sum of all the reinforcements that will be received in the future. In this setting, we are able to prove general upper bounds on the performance of a slightly modified version of Sutton's so-called TD() algorithm. These bounds are stated in terms of the performance of the best linear predictor on the given training sequence, and are proved without making any statistical assumptions of any kind about the process producing the learner's observed training sequence. We also prove lower bounds on the performance of any algorithm for this learning problem, and give a similar analysis of the closely related problem of learning to predict in a model in which the learner must produce predictions for a whole batch of observations before receiving reinforcement.

Abstract: This paper investigates a technique for creating sparsely connected feed-forward neural networks which may be capable of producing networks that have very large input and output layers. The architecture appears to be particularly suited to tasks that involve sparse training data as it is able to take advantage of the sparseness to further reduce training time. Some initial results are presented based on tests on the 16 bit compression problem. ","Title: Nonlinear gated experts for time series: discovering regimes and avoiding overfitting  
Abstract: In: International Journal of Neural Systems 6 (1995) p. 373 - 399. URL of this paper: ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z, or http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~andreas/Time-Series/MyPapers/experts.ps.Z University of Colorado Computer Science Technical Report CU-CS-798-95. In the analysis and prediction of real-world systems, two of the key problems are nonstationarity(often in the form of switching between regimes), and overfitting (particularly serious for noisy processes). This article addresses these problems using gated experts, consisting of a (nonlinear) gating network, and several (also nonlinear) competing experts. Each expert learns to predict the conditional mean, and each expert adapts its width to match the noise level in its regime. The gating network learns to predict the probability of each expert, given the input. This article focuses on the case where the gating network bases its decision on information from the inputs. This can be contrasted to hidden Markov models where the decision is based on the previous state(s) (i.e., on the output of the gating network at the previous time step), as well as to averaging over several predictors. In contrast, gated experts soft-partition the input space. This article discusses the underlying statistical assumptions, derives the weight update rules, and compares the performance of gated experts to standard methods on three time series: (1) a computer-generated series, obtained by randomly switching between two nonlinear processes, (2) a time series from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition (the light intensity of a laser in chaotic state), and (3) the daily electricity demand of France, a real-world multivariate problem with structure on several time scales. The main results are (1) the gating network correctly discovers the different regimes of the process, (2) the widths associated with each expert are important for the segmentation task (and they can be used to characterize the sub-processes), and (3) there is less overfitting compared to single networks (homogeneous multi-layer perceptrons), since the experts learn to match their variances to the (local) noise levels. This can be viewed as matching the local complexity of the model to the local complexity of the data. ",0

Abstract: Creative designers often see solutions to pending design problems in the everyday objects surrounding them. This can often lead to innovation and insight, sometimes revealing new functions and purposes for common design pieces in the process. We are interested in modeling serendipitous recognition of solutions to pending problems in the context of creative mechanical design. This paper characterizes this ability, analyzing observations we have made of it, and placing it in the context of other forms of recognition. We propose a computational model to capture and explore serendipitous recognition which is based on ideas from reconstructive dynamic memory and situation assessment in case-based reasoning. ",0
"Title: Approximating Value Trees in Structured Dynamic Programming  
Abstract: We propose and examine a method of approximate dynamic programming for Markov decision processes based on structured problem representations. We assume an MDP is represented using a dynamic Bayesian network, and construct value functions using decision trees as our function representation. The size of the representation is kept within acceptable limits by pruning these value trees so that leaves represent possible ranges of values, thus approximating the value functions produced during optimization. We propose a method for detecting convergence, prove errors bounds on the resulting approximately optimal value functions and policies, and describe some preliminary experi mental results. ","Title: Theory Refinement on Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: Theory refinement is the task of updating a domain theory in the light of new cases, to be done automatically or with some expert assistance. The problem of theory refinement under uncertainty is reviewed here in the context of Bayesian statistics, a theory of belief revision. The problem is reduced to an incremental learning task as follows: the learning system is initially primed with a partial theory supplied by a domain expert, and thereafter maintains its own internal representation of alternative theories which is able to be interrogated by the domain expert and able to be incrementally refined from data. Algorithms for refinement of Bayesian networks are presented to illustrate what is meant by ""partial theory"", ""alternative theory representation"", etc. The algorithms are an incremental variant of batch learning algorithms from the literature so can work well in batch and incremental mode.",0
"Title: Using a Case Base of Surfaces to Speed-Up Reinforcement Learning  
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the exploitation of certain vision processing techniques to index into a case base of surfaces. The surfaces are the result of reinforcement learning and represent the optimum choice of actions to achieve some goal from anywhere in the state space. This paper shows how strong features that occur in the interaction of the system with its environment can be detected early in the learning process. Such features allow the system to identify when an identical, or very similar, task has been solved previously and to retrieve the relevant surface. This results in an orders of magnitude increase in learning rate. ","Title: A comparison of the fixed and floating building block representation in the genetic algorithm  
Abstract: This article compares the traditional, fixed problem representation style of a genetic algorithm (GA) with a new floating representation in which the building blocks of a problem are not fixed at specific locations on the individuals of the population. In addition, the effects of non-coding segments on both of these representations is studied. Non-coding segments are a computational model of non-coding DNA and floating building blocks mimic the location independence of genes. The fact that these structures are prevalent in natural genetic systems suggests that they may provide some advantages to the evolutionary process. Our results show that there is a significant difference in how GAs solve a problem in the fixed and floating representations. GAs are able to maintain a more diverse population with the floating representation. The combination of non-coding segments and floating building blocks appears to encourage a GA to take advantage of its parallel search and recombination abilities. ",0
"Title: Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery examples, estimating attributes, explanation ability,
Abstract: We compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms in the problem of prognos-tics of the femoral neck fracture recovery: the K-nearest neighbours algorithm, the semi-naive Bayesian classifier, backpropagation with weight elimination learning of the multilayered neural networks, the LFC (lookahead feature construction) algorithm, and the Assistant-I and Assistant-R algorithms for top down induction of decision trees using information gain and RELIEFF as search heuristics, respectively. We compare the prognostic accuracy and the explanation ability of different classifiers. Among the different algorithms the semi-naive Bayesian classifier and Assistant-R seem to be the most appropriate. We analyze the combination of decisions of several classifiers for solving prediction problems and show that the combined classifier improves both performance and the explanation ability. ","Title: Learning policies for partially observable environments: Scaling up  
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (pomdp's) model decision problems in which an agent tries to maximize its reward in the face of limited and/or noisy sensor feedback. While the study of pomdp's is motivated by a need to address realistic problems, existing techniques for finding optimal behavior do not appear to scale well and have been unable to find satisfactory policies for problems with more than a dozen states. After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of finding near-optimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature. In contrast, we show that none are able to solve a slightly larger and noisier problem based on robot navigation. We find that a combination of two novel approaches performs well on these problems and suggest methods for scaling to even larger and more complicated domains.",0
"Title: Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing by a Multiple Scale Neural System for Boundary and Surface Representation  
Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.","Title: Learning Unions of Boxes with Membership and Equivalence Queries  
Abstract: We present two algorithms that use membership and equivalence queries to exactly identify the concepts given by the union of s discretized axis-parallel boxes in d-dimensional discretized Euclidean space where each coordinate can have n discrete values. The first algorithm receives at most sd counterexamples and uses time and membership queries polynomial in s and log n for d any constant. Further, all equivalence queries made can be formulated as the union of O(sd log s) axis-parallel boxes. Next, we introduce a new complexity measure that better captures the complexity of a union of boxes than simply the number of boxes and dimensions. Our new measure, , is the number of segments in the target polyhedron where a segment is a maximum portion of one of the sides of the polyhedron that lies entirely inside or entirely outside each of the other halfspaces defining the polyhedron. We then present an improvement of our first algorithm that uses time and queries polynomial in and log n. The hypothesis class used here is decision trees of height at most 2sd. Further we can show that the time and queries used by this algorithm are polynomial in d and log n for s any constant thus generalizing the exact learnability of DNF formulas with a constant number of terms. In fact, this single algorithm is efficient for either s or d constant. ",0
"Title: Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems  
Abstract: Increasing attention has been paid to reinforcement learning algorithms in recent years, partly due to successes in the theoretical analysis of their behavior in Markov environments. If the Markov assumption is removed, however, neither generally the algorithms nor the analyses continue to be usable. We propose and analyze a new learning algorithm to solve a certain class of non-Markov decision problems. Our algorithm applies to problems in which the environment is Markov, but the learner has restricted access to state information. The algorithm involves a Monte-Carlo policy evaluation combined with a policy improvement method that is similar to that of Markov decision problems and is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum. The algorithm operates in the space of stochastic policies, a space which can yield a policy that performs considerably better than any deterministic policy. Although the space of stochastic policies is continuous|even for a discrete action space|our algorithm is computationally tractable. ","Title: Landscapes, Learning Costs and Genetic Assimilation.  
Abstract: The evolution of a population can be guided by phenotypic traits acquired by members of that population during their lifetime. This phenomenon, known as the Baldwin Effect, can speed the evolutionary process as traits that are initially acquired become genetically specified in later generations. This paper presents conditions under which this genetic assimilation can take place. As well as the benefits that lifetime adaptation can give a population, there may be a cost to be paid for that adaptive ability. It is the evolutionary trade-off between these costs and benefits that provides the selection pressure for acquired traits to become genetically specified. It is also noted that genotypic space, in which evolution operates, and phenotypic space, on which adaptive processes (such as learning) operate, are, in general, of a different nature. To guarantee an acquired characteristic can become genetically specified, then these spaces must have the property of neighbourhood correlation which means that a small distance between two individuals in phenotypic space implies that there is a small distance between the same two individuals in genotypic space.",0
"Title: Bootstrapping with Noise: An Effective Regularization Technique  
Abstract: Bootstrap samples with noise are shown to be an effective smoothness and capacity control technique for training feed-forward networks and for other statistical methods such as generalized additive models. It is shown that noisy bootstrap performs best in conjunction with weight decay regularization and ensemble averaging. The two-spiral problem, a highly non-linear noise-free data, is used to demonstrate these findings. The combination of noisy bootstrap and ensemble averaging is also shown useful for generalized additive modeling, and is also demonstrated on the well known Cleveland Heart Data [7].","Title: Planning and Acting in Partially Observable Stochastic Domains  
Abstract: In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (mdps) and partially observable mdps (pomdps). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving pomdps off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a pomdp. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to pomdps, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions. Consider the problem of a robot navigating in a large office building. The robot can move from hallway intersection to intersection and can make local observations of its world. Its actions are not completely reliable, however. Sometimes, when it intends to move, it stays where it is or goes too far; sometimes, when it intends to turn, it overshoots. It has similar problems with observation. Sometimes a corridor looks like a corner; sometimes a T-junction looks like an L-junction. How can such an error-plagued robot navigate, even given a map of the corridors? In general, the robot will have to remember something about its history of actions and observations and use this information, together with its knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the world (the map and other information), to maintain an estimate of its location. Many engineering applications follow this approach, using methods like the Kalman filter [18] to maintain a running estimate of the robot's spatial uncertainty, expressed as an ellipsoid or normal distribution in Cartesian space. This approach will not do for our robot, though. Its uncertainty may be discrete: it might be almost certain that it is in the north-east corner of either the fourth or the seventh floors, though it admits a chance that it is on the fifth floor, as well. Then, given an uncertain estimate of its location, the robot has to decide what actions to take. In some cases, it might be sufficient to ignore its uncertainty and take actions that would be appropriate for the most likely location. In other cases, it might be better for ",0

Abstract: In this paper we examine the behavior of a human-computer system for crisis response. As one instance of crisis management, we describe the task of responding to spills and fires involving hazardous materials. We then describe INCA, an intelligent assistant for planning and scheduling in this domain, and its relation to human users. We focus on INCA's strategy of retrieving a case from a case library, seeding the initial schedule, and then helping the user adapt this seed. We also present three hypotheses about the behavior of this mixed-initiative system and some experiments designed to test them. The results suggest that our approach leads to faster response development than user-generated or automatically-generated schedules but without sacrificing solution quality.

Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of the properties of genetic algorithms (GAs) being used for function optimization (GAFOs) is not as strong as we would like. Traditional schema analysis provides some first order insights, but doesn't capture the non-linear dynamics of the GA search process very well. Markov chain theory has been used primarily for steady state analysis of GAs. In this paper we explore the use of transient Markov chain analysis to model and understand the behavior of finite population GAFOs observed while in transition to steady states. This approach appears to provide new insights into the circumstances under which GAFOs will (will not) perform well. Some preliminary results are presented and an initial evaluation of the merits of this approach is provided. ",0

Abstract: The Fourier transform of boolean functions has come to play an important role in proving many important learnability results. We aim to demonstrate that the Fourier transform techniques are also a useful and practical algorithm in addition to being a powerful theoretical tool. We describe the more prominent changes we have introduced to the algorithm, ones that were crucial and without which the performance of the algorithm would severely deteriorate. One of the benefits we present is the confidence level for each prediction which measures the likelihood the prediction is correct.","Title: Where Genetic Algorithms Excel  
Abstract: We analyze the performance of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) we call Culling and a variety of other algorithms on a problem we refer to as Additive Search Problem (ASP). ASP is closely related to several previously well studied problems, such as the game of Mastermind and additive fitness functions. We show that the problem of learning the Ising perceptron is reducible to a noisy version of ASP. Culling is efficient on ASP, highly noise tolerant, and the best known approach in some regimes. Noisy ASP is the first problem we are aware of where a Genetic Type Algorithm bests all known competitors. Standard GA's, by contrast, perform much more poorly on ASP than hillclimbing and other approaches even though the Schema theorem holds for ASP. We generalize ASP to k-ASP to study whether GA's will achieve `implicit parallelism' in a problem with many more schemata. GA's fail to achieve this implicit parallelism, but we describe an algorithm we call Explicitly Parallel Search that succeeds. We also compute the optimal culling point for selective breeding, which turns out to be independent of the fitness function or the population distribution. We also analyze a Mean Field Theoretic algorithm performing similarly to Culling on many problems. These results provide insight into when and how GA's can beat competing methods. ",0
"Title: The Nonlinear PCA Learning Rule and Signal Separation Mathematical Analysis  
Abstract: Constructive induction divides the problem of learning an inductive hypothesis into two intertwined searches: onefor the best representation space, and twofor the best hypothesis in that space. In data-driven constructive induction (DCI), a learning system searches for a better representation space by analyzing the input examples (data). The presented data-driven constructive induction method combines an AQ-type learning algorithm with two classes of representation space improvement operators: constructors, and destructors. The implemented system, AQ17-DCI, has been experimentally applied to a GNP prediction problem using a World Bank database. The results show that decision rules learned by AQ17-DCI outperformed the rules learned in the original representation space both in predictive accuracy and rule simplicity.","Title: Using Bayesian networks for incorporating probabilistic a priori knowledge into Boltzmann machines  
Abstract: We present a method for automatically determining the structure and the connection weights of a Boltzmann machine corresponding to a given Bayesian network representation of a probability distribution on a set of discrete variables. The resulting Boltzmann machine structure can be implemented efficiently on massively parallel hardware, since the structure can be divided into two separate clusters where all the nodes in one cluster can be updated simultaneously. The updating process of the Boltzmann machine approximates a Gibbs sampling process of the original Bayesian network in the sense that the Boltzmann machine converges to the same final state as the Gibbs sampler does. The mapping from a Bayesian network to a Boltzmann machine can be seen as a method for incorporating probabilistic a priori information into a neural network architecture, which can then be trained further with existing learning algorithms.

"Title: Learning in neural networks with Bayesian prototypes  
Abstract: Given a set of samples of a probability distribution on a set of discrete random variables, we study the problem of constructing a good approximative neural network model of the underlying probability distribution. Our approach is based on an unsupervised learning scheme where the samples are first divided into separate clusters, and each cluster is then coded as a single vector. These Bayesian prototype vectors consist of conditional probabilities representing the attribute-value distribution inside the corresponding cluster. Using these prototype vectors, it is possible to model the underlying joint probability distribution as a simple Bayesian network (a tree), which can be realized as a feedforward neural network capable of probabilistic reasoning. In this framework, learning means choosing the size of the prototype set, partitioning the samples into the corresponding clusters, and constructing the cluster prototypes. We describe how the prototypes can be determined, given a partition of the samples, and present a method for evaluating the likelihood of the corresponding Bayesian tree. We also present a greedy heuristic for searching through the space of different partition schemes with different numbers of clusters, aiming at an optimal approximation of the probability distribution.

The use of this library relieve the user from the details of a specific parallel programming paradigm and at the same time allows a greater portability of the generated code. To provide a comparision with existing solutions, we survey the most relevant implementations of the algorithm proposed so far in the literature, both on dedicated and general purpose computers. Extensive experimental results show that the use of the library does not hurt the performance of our simulator, on the contrary our implementation on a Connection Machine (CM-5) is comparable with the fastest in its category.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a new selforganizing decomposition technique for learning high-dimensional mappings. Problem decomposition is performed in an error-driven manner, such that the resulting subtasks (patches) are equally well approximated. Our method combines an unsupervised learning scheme (Feature Maps [Koh84]) with a nonlinear approximator (Backpropagation [RHW86]). The resulting learning system is more stable and effective in changing environments than plain backpropagation and much more powerful than extended feature maps as proposed by [RS88, RMS89]. Extensions of our method give rise to active exploration strategies for autonomous agents facing unknown environments. The appropriateness of our general purpose method will be demonstrated with an ex ample from mathematical function approximation.","Title: Refining Conversational Case Libraries  
Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) shells (e.g., Inference's CBR Express) are commercially successful tools for supporting the development of help desk and related applications. In contrast to rule-based expert systems, they capture knowledge as cases rather than more problematic rules, and they can be incrementally extended. However, rather than eliminate the knowledge engineering bottleneck, they refocus it on case engineering, the task of carefully authoring cases according to library design guidelines to ensure good performance. Designing complex libraries according to these guidelines is difficult; software is needed to assist users with case authoring. We describe an approach for revising case libraries according to design guidelines, its implementation in Clire, and empirical results showing that, under some conditions, this approach can improve conversational CBR performance.",0

"Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine  
Abstract: The clausal discovery engine claudien is presented. claudien discovers regularities in data and is a representative of the inductive logic programming paradigm. As such, it represents data and regularities by means of first order clausal theories. Because the search space of clausal theories is larger than that of attribute value representation, claudien also accepts as input a declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities. Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique. In order to achieve this aim, we show how claudien can be used to learn 1) integrity constraints in databases, 2) functional dependencies and determinations, 3) properties of sequences, 4) mixed quantitative and qualitative laws, 5) reverse engineering, and 6) classification rules.

Abstract: Previous approaches to multi-agent reinforcement learning are either very limited or heuristic by nature. The main reason is: each agent's or ""animat's"" environment continually changes because the other learning animats keep changing. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot properly deal with this. Their convergence theorems require repeatable trials and strong (typically Markovian) assumptions about the environment. In this paper, however, we use a novel, general, sound method for multiple, reinforcement learning ""animats"", each living a single life with limited computational resources in an unrestricted, changing environment. The method is called ""incremental self-improvement"" (IS | Schmidhuber, 1994). IS properly takes into account that whatever some animat learns at some point may affect learning conditions for other animats or for itself at any later point. The learning algorithm of an IS-based animat is embedded in its own policy | the animat cannot only improve its performance, but in principle also improve the way it improves etc. At certain times in the animat's life, IS uses reinforcement/time ratios to estimate from a single training example (namely the entire life so far) which previously learned things are still useful, and selectively keeps them but gets rid of those that start appearing harmful. IS is based on an efficient, stack-based backtracking procedure which is guaranteed to make each animat's learning history a history of long-term reinforcement accelerations. Experiments demonstrate IS' effectiveness. In one experiment, IS learns a sequence of more and more complex function approximation problems. In another, a multi-agent system consisting of three co-evolving, IS-based animats chasing each other learns interesting, stochastic predator and prey strategies. ",0
"Title: Lazy Induction Triggered by CBR  
Abstract: In recent years, case-based reasoning has been demonstrated to be highly useful for problem solving in complex domains. Also, mixed paradigm approaches emerged for combining CBR and induction techniques aiming at verifying the knowledge and/or building an efficient case memory. However, in complex domains induction over the whole problem space is often not possible or too time consuming. In this paper, an approach is presented which (owing to a close interaction with the CBR part) attempts to induce rules only for a particular context, i.e. for a problem just being solved by a CBR-oriented system. These rules may then be used for indexing purposes or similarity assessment in order to support the CBR process in the future. ","Title: Selecting Input Variables Using Mutual Information and Nonparametric Density Estimation  
Abstract: In learning problems where a connectionist network is trained with a finite sized training set, better generalization performance is often obtained when unneeded weights in the network are eliminated. One source of unneeded weights comes from the inclusion of input variables that provide little information about the output variables. We propose a method for identifying and eliminating these input variables. The method first determines the relationship between input and output variables using nonparametric density estimation and then measures the relevance of input variables using the information theoretic concept of mutual information. We present results from our method on a simple toy problem and a nonlinear time series.",0
"Title: Machine Learning Methods for International Conflict Databases: A Case Study in Predicting Mediation Outcome  
Abstract: This paper tries to identify rules and factors that are predictive for the outcome of international conflict management attempts. We use C4.5, an advanced Machine Learning algorithm, for generating decision trees and prediction rules from cases in the CONFMAN database. The results show that simple patterns and rules are often not only more understandable, but also more reliable than complex rules. Simple decision trees are able to improve the chances of correctly predicting the outcome of a conflict management attempt. This suggests that mediation is more repetitive than conflicts per se, where such results have not been achieved so far. ","Title: Using Real-Valued Genetic Algorithms to Evolve Rule Sets for Classification  
Abstract: In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of classification rules with real-valued attributes. We show how real-valued attribute ranges can be encoded with real-valued genes and present a new uniform method for representing don't cares in the rules. We view supervised classification as an optimization problem, and evolve rule sets that maximize the number of correct classifications of input instances. We use a variant of the Pitt approach to genetic-based machine learning system with a novel conflict resolution mechanism between competing rules within the same rule set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on a benchmark wine classifier system. ",0
"Title: Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms  
Abstract: We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ""basecase"" oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a compu-tationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.","Title: EMERGENT BEHAVIOUR IN CO-EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN  
Abstract: An important aspect of creative design is the concept of emergence. Though emergence is important, its mechanism is either not well understood or it is limited to the domain of shapes. This deficiency can be compensated by considering definitions of emergent behaviour from the Artificial Life (ALife) research community. With these new insights, it is proposed that a computational technique, called evolving representations of design genes, can be extended to emergent behaviour. We demonstrate emergent be-haviour in a co-evolutionary model of design. This co-evolutionary approach to design allows a solution space (structure space) to evolve in response to a problem space (be-haviour space). Since the behaviour space is now an active participant, behaviour may emerge with new structures at the end of the design process. This paper hypothesizes that emergent behaviour can be identified using the same technique. The floor plan example of (Gero & Schnier 1995) is extended to demonstrate how behaviour can emerge in a co-evolutionary design process. ",0
"Title: Interpolation Models with Multiple  
Abstract: A traditional interpolation model is characterized by the choice of reg-ularizer applied to the interpolant, and the choice of noise model. Typically, the regularizer has a single regularization constant ff, and the noise model has a single parameter fi. The ratio ff=fi alone is responsible for determining globally all these attributes of the interpolant: its `complexity', `flexibility', `smoothness', `characteristic scale length', and `characteristic amplitude'. We suggest that interpolation models should be able to capture more than just one flavour of simplicity and complexity. We describe Bayesian models in which the interpolant has a smoothness that varies spatially. We emphasize the importance, in practical implementation, of the concept of `conditional convexity' when designing models with many hyperparameters. We apply the new models to the interpolation of neuronal spike data and demonstrate a substantial improvement in generalization error. ","Title: PREENS, a Parallel Research Execution Environment for Neural Systems  
Abstract: PREENS a Parallel Research Execution Environment for Neural Systems is a distributed neurosimulator, targeted on networks of workstations and transputer systems. As current applications of neural networks often contain large amounts of data and as the neural networks involved in tasks such as vision are very large, high requirements on memory and computational resources are imposed on the target execution platforms. PREENS can be executed in a distributed environment, i.e. tools and neural network simulation programs can be running on any machine connectable via TCP/IP. Using this approach, larger tasks and more data can be examined using an efficient coarse grained parallelism. Furthermore, the design of PREENS allows for neural networks to be running on any high performance MIMD machine such as a trans-puter system. In this paper, the different features and design concepts of PREENS are discussed. These can also be used for other applications, like image processing.",0
"Title: Feature selection through Functional Links with Evolutionary Computation for Neural Networks  
Abstract: In this paper we describe different ways to select and transform features using evolutionary computation. The features are intended to serve as inputs to a feedforward network. The first way is the selection of features using a standard genetic algorithm, and the solution found specifies whether a certain feature should be present or not. We show that for the prediction of unemployment rates in various European countries, this is a succesfull approach. In fact, this kind of selection of features is a special case of so-called functional links. Functional links transform the input pattern space to a new pattern space. As functional links one can use polynomials, or more general functions. Both can be found using evolutionary computation. Polynomial functional links are found by evolving a coding of the powers of the polynomial. For symbolic functions we can use genetic programming. Genetic programming finds the symbolic functions that are to be applied to the inputs. We compare the workings of the latter two methods on two artificial datasets, and on a real-world medical image dataset.","Title: Rates of convergence of the Hastings and Metropolis algorithms  
Abstract: We apply recent results in Markov chain theory to Hastings and Metropolis algorithms with either independent or symmetric candidate distributions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithms to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . In the independence case (in IR k ) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of ; in the symmetric case (in IR only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective.

"Title: Towards More Creative Case-Based Design Systems  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has a great deal to offer in supporting creative design, particularly processes that rely heavily on previous design experience, such as framing the problem and evaluating design alternatives. However, most existing CBR systems are not living up to their potential. They tend to adapt and reuse old solutions in routine ways, producing robust but uninspired results. Little research effort has been directed towards the kinds of situation assessment, evaluation, and assimilation processes that facilitate the exploration of ideas and the elaboration and redefinition of problems that are crucial to creative design. Also, their typically rigid control structures do not facilitate the kinds of strategic control and opportunism inherent in creative reasoning. In this paper, we describe the types of behavior we would like case-based design systems to support, based on a study of designers working on a mechanical engineering problem. We show how the standard CBR framework should be extended and we describe an architecture we are developing to experiment with these ideas. 1 ","Title: Signal Separation by Nonlinear Hebbian Learning  
Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formalism each employs to handle uncertainty may not be uniform. In order to be able to combine these knowledge bases of different formats, we need to first establish a common basis for characterizing and evaluating the different formalisms, and provide a semantics for the combined mechanism. A common framework can provide an infrastructure for building an integrated system, and is essential if we are to understand its behavior. We present a unifying framework based on an ordered partition of possible worlds called partition sequences, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of biasing towards certain possible scenarios when we are uncertain of the actual situation. We show that some of the existing formalisms, namely, default logic, autoepistemic logic, probabilistic conditioning and thresholding (generalized conditioning), and possibility theory can be incorporated into this general framework.",0
"Title: Constructing Computationally Efficient Bayesian Models via Unsupervised Clustering  Probabilistic Reasoning and Bayesian Belief Networks,  
Abstract: Given a set of samples of an unknown probability distribution, we study the problem of constructing a good approximative Bayesian network model of the probability distribution in question. This task can be viewed as a search problem, where the goal is to find a maximal probability network model, given the data. In this work, we do not make an attempt to learn arbitrarily complex multi-connected Bayesian network structures, since such resulting models can be unsuitable for practical purposes due to the exponential amount of time required for the reasoning task. Instead, we restrict ourselves to a special class of simple tree-structured Bayesian networks called Bayesian prototype trees, for which a polynomial time algorithm for Bayesian reasoning exists. We show how the probability of a given Bayesian prototype tree model can be evaluated, given the data, and how this evaluation criterion can be used in a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm for searching the model space. The simulated annealing algorithm provably finds the maximal probability model, provided that a sufficient amount of time is used.","Title: Sequential Importance Sampling for Nonparametric Bayes Models: The Next Generation Running Title: SIS for Nonparametric Bayes  
Abstract: There are two generations of Gibbs sampling methods for semi-parametric models involving the Dirichlet process. The first generation suffered from a severe drawback; namely that the locations of the clusters, or groups of parameters, could essentially become fixed, moving only rarely. Two strategies that have been proposed to create the second generation of Gibbs samplers are integration and appending a second stage to the Gibbs sampler wherein the cluster locations are moved. We show that these same strategies are easily implemented for the sequential importance sampler, and that the first strategy dramatically improves results. As in the case of Gibbs sampling, these strategies are applicable to a much wider class of models. They are shown to provide more uniform importance sampling weights and lead to additional Rao-Blackwellization of estimators.

"Title: Evolution of Non-Deterministic Incremental Algorithms as a New Approach for Search in State Spaces  
Abstract: Let us call a non-deterministic incremental algorithm one that is able to construct any solution to a combinatorial problem by selecting incrementally an ordered sequence of choices that defines this solution, each choice being made non-deterministically. In that case, the state space can be represented as a tree, and a solution is a path from the root of that tree to a leaf. This paper describes how the simulated evolution of a population of such non-deterministic incremental algorithms offers a new approach for the exploration of a state space, compared to other techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Strategies (ES) or Hill Climbing. In particular, the efficiency of this method, implemented as the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model, is presented for the sorting network problem, a reference problem that has challenged computer science. Then, we shall show that the END model remedies some drawbacks of these optimization techniques and even outperforms them for this problem. Indeed, some 16-input sorting networks as good as the best known have been built from scratch, and even a 25-year-old result for the 13-input problem has been improved by one comparator.","Title: Statistical Theory of Overtraining Is Cross-Validation Asymptotically Effective?  
Abstract: A statistical theory for overtraining is proposed. The analysis treats realizable stochastic neural networks, trained with Kullback-Leibler loss in the asymptotic case. It is shown that the asymptotic gain in the generalization error is small if we perform early stopping, even if we have access to the optimal stopping time. Considering cross-validation stopping we answer the question: In what ratio the examples should be divided into training and testing sets in order to obtain the optimum performance. In the non-asymptotic region cross-validated early stopping always decreases the generalization error. Our large scale simulations done on a CM5 are in nice agreement with our analytical findings.

"Title: Predicting Lifetimes in Dynamically Allocated Memory  
Abstract: Predictions of lifetimes of dynamically allocated objects can be used to improve time and space efficiency of dynamic memory management in computer programs. Barrett and Zorn [1993] used a simple lifetime predictor and demonstrated this improvement on a variety of computer programs. In this paper, we use decision trees to do lifetime prediction on the same programs and show significantly better prediction. Our method also has the advantage that during training we can use a large number of features and let the decision tree automatically choose the relevant subset.","Title: Specialization of Logic Programs by Pruning SLD-Trees  
Abstract: program w.r.t. positive and negative examples can be viewed as the problem of pruning an SLD-tree such that all refutations of negative examples and no refutations of positive examples are excluded. It is shown that the actual pruning can be performed by applying unfolding and clause removal. The algorithm spectre is presented, which is based on this idea. The input to the algorithm is, besides a logic program and positive and negative examples, a computation rule, which determines the shape of the SLD-tree that is to be pruned. It is shown that the generality of the resulting specialization is dependent on the computation rule, and experimental results are presented from using three different computation rules. The experiments indicate that the computation rule should be formulated so that the number of applications of unfolding is kept as low as possible. The algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method, is also compared with a covering algorithm. The experiments show that a higher predictive accuracy can be achieved if the focus is on discriminating positive from negative examples rather than on achieving a high coverage of positive examples only.

"Title: Worst-case Quadratic Loss Bounds for Prediction Using Linear Functions and Gradient Descent  
Abstract: In this paper we study the performance of gradient descent when applied to the problem of on-line linear prediction in arbitrary inner product spaces. We prove worst-case bounds on the sum of the squared prediction errors under various assumptions concerning the amount of a priori information about the sequence to predict. The algorithms we use are variants and extensions of on-line gradient descent. Whereas our algorithms always predict using linear functions as hypotheses, none of our results requires the data to be linearly related. In fact, the bounds proved on the total prediction loss are typically expressed as a function of the total loss of the best fixed linear predictor with bounded norm. All the upper bounds are tight to within constants. Matching lower bounds are provided in some cases. Finally, we apply our results to the problem of on-line prediction for classes of smooth functions. ","Title: A GENERAL METHOD FOR INCREMENTAL SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND MULTI-AGENT LEARNING  
Abstract: Process simulation has emerged as a valuable tool for process design, analysis and operation. In this work, we extend the capabilities of iterated linear programming (LP) for dealing with problems encountered in dynamic nonsmooth process simulation. A previously developed LP method is refined with the addition of a new descent strategy which combines line search with a trust region approach. This adds more stability and efficiency to the method. The LP method has the advantage of naturally dealing with profile bounds as well. This is demonstrated to avoid the computational difficulties which arise from the iterates going into physically unrealistic regions. A new method for the treatment of discontinuities occurring in dynamic simulation problems is also presented in this paper. The method ensures that any event which has occurred within the time interval in consideration is detected and if more than one event occurs, the detected one is indeed the earliest one. A specific class of implicitly discontinuous process simulation problems, phase equilibrium calculations is also looked at. A new formulation is introduced to solve multiphase problems. fl To whom all correspondence should be addressed. email:biegler@cmu.edu",0
"Title: A Comparative Study of Genetic Search  
Abstract: We present a comparative study of genetic algorithms and their search properties when treated as a combinatorial optimization technique. This is done in the context of the NP-hard problem MAX-SAT, the comparison being relative to the Metropolis process, and by extension, simulated annealing. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show that for large and difficult MAX-SAT instances, the contribution of cross-over to the search process is marginal. Little is lost if it is dispensed altogether, running mutation and selection as an enlarged Metropolis process. Second, we show that for these problem instances, genetic search consistently performs worse than simulated annealing when subject to similar resource bounds. The correspondence between the two algorithms is made more precise via a decomposition argument, and provides a framework for interpreting our results. ","Title: Analysis of the Numerical Effects of Parallelism on a Parallel Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of relaxed synchronization on both the numerical and parallel efficiency of parallel genetic algorithms (GAs). We describe a coarse-grain geographically structured parallel genetic algorithm. Our experiments provide preliminary evidence that asynchronous versions of these algorithms have a lower run time than synchronous GAs. Our analysis shows that this improvement is due to (1) decreased synchronization costs and (2) high numerical efficiency (e.g. fewer function evaluations) for the asynchronous GAs. This analysis includes a critique of the utility of traditional parallel performance measures for parallel GAs. ",0
"Title: Probabilistic Independence Networks for Hidden Markov Probability Models  
Abstract: Graphical techniques for modeling the dependencies of random variables have been explored in a variety of different areas including statistics, statistical physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image processing, and genetics. Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively independently in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The paper contains a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the graphical model framework to illustrate the advantages of the general approach.","Title: Decomposable graphical Gaussian model determination  
Abstract: We propose a methodology for Bayesian model determination in decomposable graphical Gaussian models. To achieve this aim we consider a hyper inverse Wishart prior distribution on the concentration matrix for each given graph. To ensure compatibility across models, such prior distributions are obtained by marginalisation from the prior conditional on the complete graph. We explore alternative structures for the hyperparameters of the latter, and their consequences for the model. Model determination is carried out by implementing a reversible jump MCMC sampler. In particular, the dimension-changing move we propose involves adding or dropping an edge from the graph. We characterise the set of moves which preserve the decomposability of the graph, giving a fast algorithm for maintaining the junction tree representation of the graph at each sweep. As state variable, we propose to use the incomplete variance-covariance matrix, containing only the elements for which the corresponding element of the inverse is nonzero. This allows all computations to be performed locally, at the clique level, which is a clear advantage for the analysis of large and complex data-sets. Finally, the statistical and computational performance of the procedure is illustrated by means of both artificial and real multidimensional data-sets. ",0
"Title: Fools Gold: Extracting Finite State Machines From Recurrent Network Dynamics  
Abstract: Several recurrent networks have been proposed as representations for the task of formal language learning. After training a recurrent network, the next step is to understand the information processing carried out by the network. Some researchers (Giles et al., 1992; Watrous & Kuhn, 1992; Cleeremans et al., 1989) have resorted to extracting finite state machines from the internal state trajectories of their recurrent networks. This paper describes two conditions, sensitivity to initial conditions and frivolous computational explanations due to discrete measurements (Kolen & Pollack, 1993), which allow these extraction methods to return illusionary finite state descriptions.","Title: Between MDPs and Semi-MDPs: Learning, Planning, and Representing Knowledge at Multiple Temporal Scales  
Abstract: Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels of temporal abstraction are key challenges for AI. In this paper we develop an approach to these problems based on the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action to include options|whole courses of behavior that may be temporally extended, stochastic, and contingent on events. Examples of options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Options may be given a priori, learned by experience, or both. They may be used interchangeably with actions in a variety of planning and learning methods. The theory of semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) can be applied to model the consequences of options and as a basis for planning and learning methods using them. In this paper we develop these connections, building on prior work by Bradtke and Duff (1995), Parr (in prep.) and others. Our main novel results concern the interface between the MDP and SMDP levels of analysis. We show how a set of options can be altered by changing only their termination conditions to improve over SMDP methods with no additional cost. We also introduce intra-option temporal-difference methods that are able to learn from fragments of an option's execution. Finally, we propose a notion of subgoal which can be used to improve the options themselves. Overall, we argue that options and their models provide hitherto missing aspects of a powerful, clear, and expressive framework for representing and organizing knowledge.",0
"Title: Natural Gradient Descent for Training Multi-Layer Perceptrons  
Abstract: The main difficulty in implementing the natural gradient learning rule is to compute the inverse of the Fisher information matrix when the input dimension is large. We have found a new scheme to represent the Fisher information matrix. Based on this scheme, we have designed an algorithm to compute the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. When the input dimension n is much larger than the number of hidden neurons, the complexity of this algorithm is of order O(n 2 ) while the complexity of conventional algorithms for the same purpose is of order O(n 3 ). The simulation has confirmed the efficience and robustness of the natural gradient learning rule.","Title: Learning to Reason with a Restricted View  
Abstract: The Learning to Reason framework combines the study of Learning and Reasoning into a single task. Within it, learning is done specifically for the purpose of reasoning with the learned knowledge. Computational considerations show that this is a useful paradigm; in some cases learning and reasoning problems that are intractable when studied separately become tractable when performed as a task of Learning to Reason. In this paper we study Learning to Reason problems where the interaction with the world supplies the learner only partial information in the form of partial assignments. Several natural interpretations of partial assignments are considered and learning and reasoning algorithms using these are developed. The results presented exhibit a tradeoff between learnability, the strength of the oracles used in the interface, and the range of reasoning queries the learner is guaranteed to answer correctly.",0

Abstract To achieve high performance, contemporary computer systems rely on two forms of parallelism: instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and thread-level parallelism (TLP). Wide-issue superscalar processors exploit ILP by executing multiple instructions from a single program in a single cycle. Multiprocessors (MP) exploit TLP by executing different threads in parallel on different processors. Unfortunately, both parallel-processing styles statically partition processor resources, thus preventing them from adapting to dynamically-changing levels of ILP and TLP in a program. With insufficient TLP, processors in an MP will be idle; with insufficient ILP, multiple-issue hardware on a superscalar is wasted. This paper explores parallel processing on an alternative architecture, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which allows multiple threads to compete for and share all of the processors resources every cycle. The most compelling reason for running parallel applications on an SMT processor is its ability to use thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism interchangeably. By permitting multiple threads to share the processors functional units simultaneously, the processor can use both ILP and TLP to accommodate variations in parallelism. When a program has only a single thread, all of the SMT processors resources can be dedicated to that thread; when more TLP exists, this parallelism can compensate for a lack of ","Title: Inductive Constraint Logic and the Mutagenesis Problem  
Abstract: A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form. We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical approaches.",0
"Title: Stochastic search in inductive concept learning  
Abstract: Concept learning can be viewed as search of the space of concept descriptions. The hypothesis language determines the search space. In standard inductive learning algorithms, the structure of the search space is determined by generalization/specialization operators. Algorithms perform locally optimal search by using a hill-climbing and/or a beam-search strategy. To overcome this limitation, concept learning can be viewed as stochastic search of the space of concept descriptions. The proposed stochastic search method is based on simulated annealing which is known as a successful means for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The stochastic search method, implemented in a rule learning system ATRIS, is based on a compact and efficient representation of the problem and the appropriate operators for structuring the search space. Furthermore, by heuristic pruning of the search space, the method enables also handling of imperfect data. The paper introduces the stochastic search method, describes the ATRIS learning algorithm and gives results of the experiments. ","Title: Problem Formulation, Program Synthesis and Program Transformation Techniques for Simulation, Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction (Research Statement)  
Abstract: A parallel version is proposed for a fundamental theorem of serial unconstrained optimization. The parallel theorem allows each of k parallel processors to use simultaneously a different algorithm, such as a descent, Newton, quasi-Newton or a conjugate gradient algorithm. Each processor can perform one or many steps of a serial algorithm on a portion of the gradient of the objective function assigned to it, independently of the other processors. Eventually a synchronization step is performed which, for differentiable convex functions, consists of taking a strong convex combination of the k points found by the k processors. For nonconvex, as well as convex, differentiable functions, the best point found by the k processors is taken, or any better point. The fundamental result that we establish is that any accumulation point of the parallel algorithm is stationary for the nonconvex case, and is a global solution for the convex case. Computational testing on the Thinking Machines CM-5 multiprocessor indicate a speedup of the order of the number of processors employed. ",0

"Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms  
Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.","Title: ON-LINE LEARNING OF LINEAR FUNCTIONS

","Title: Journal of Convex Analysis (accepted for publication) A HYBRID PROJECTION-PROXIMAL POINT ALGORITHM  
Abstract: We propose a modification of the classical proximal point algorithm for finding zeroes of a maximal monotone operator in a Hilbert space. In particular, an approximate proximal point iteration is used to construct a hyperplane which strictly separates the current iterate from the solution set of the problem. This step is then followed by a projection of the current iterate onto the separating hyperplane. All information required for this projection operation is readily available at the end of the approximate proximal step, and therefore this projection entails no additional computational cost. The new algorithm allows significant relaxation of tolerance requirements imposed on the solution of proximal point subproblems, which yields a more practical framework. Weak global convergence and local linear rate of convergence are established under suitable assumptions. Additionally, presented analysis yields an alternative proof of convergence for the exact proximal point method, which allows a nice geometric interpretation, and is somewhat more intuitive than the classical proof.

Results are presented comparing the Extentron to other neural network paradigms and to symbolic learning systems. ",0
"Title: Connectionist Modeling of the Fast Mapping Phenomenon  
Abstract: The problem of making optimal decisions in uncertain conditions is central to Artificial Intelligence. If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action, or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning methods, a combination that was very effective in our test cases. ","Title: Extracting Tree-Structured Representations of Trained Networks

Our experiments demonstrate that Trepan is able to produce decision trees that maintain a high level of fidelity to their respective networks while being comprehensible and accurate. Unlike previous work in this area, our algorithm is general in its applicability and scales well to large net works and problems with high-dimensional input spaces.",0

Abstract: A performance prediction method is presented for indicating the performance range of MIMD parallel processor systems for neural network simulations. The total execution time of a parallel application is modeled as the sum of its calculation and communication times. The method is scalable because based on the times measured on one processor and one communication link, the performance, speedup, and efficiency can be predicted for a larger processor system. It is validated quantitatively by applying it to two popular neural networks, backpropagation and the Kohonen self-organizing feature map, decomposed on a GCel-512, a 512 transputer system. Agreement of the model with the measurements is within 9%.",0
"Title: PREDICTION GAMES AND ARCING ALGORITHMS  
Abstract: Technical Report 504 December 19, 1997 Statistics Department University of California Berkeley, CA. (4720 Abstract The theory behind the success of adaptive reweighting and combining algorithms (arcing) such as Adaboost (Freund and Schapire [1995].[1996]) and others in reducing generalization error has not been well understood. By formulating prediction, both classification and regression, as a game where one player makes a selection from instances in the training set and the other a convex linear combination of predictors from a finite set, existing arcing algorithms are shown to be algorithms for finding good game strategies. An optimal game strategy finds a combined predictor that minimizes the maximum of the error over the training set. A bound on the generalization error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error is proven that is sharper than bounds to date. Arcing algorithms are described that converge to the optimal strategy. Schapire et.al. [1997] offered an explanation of why Adaboost works in terms of its ability to reduce the margin. Comparing Adaboost to our optimal arcing algorithm shows that their explanation is not valid and that the answer lies elsewhere. In this situation the VC-type bounds are misleading. Some empirical results are given to explore the situation. ","Title: Inverse entailment and Progol

Abstract: We present a novel application of ILP to the problem of diterpene structure elucidation from 13 C NMR spectra. Diterpenes are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effectors. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based on 13 C NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom number that corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.

Abstract: Current approaches to computational lexicology in language technology are knowledge-based (competence-oriented) and try to abstract away from specific formalisms, domains, and applications.

As an alternative, we propose a particular performance-oriented approach to Natural Language Processing based on automatic memory-based learning of linguistic (lexical) tasks. The consequences of the approach for computational lexicology are discussed, and the application of the approach on a number of lexical acquisition and disambiguation tasks in phonology, morphology and syntax is described.","Title: Using Decision Trees to Improve Case-Based Learning  
Abstract: This paper shows that decision trees can be used to improve the performance of case-based learning (CBL) systems. We introduce a performance task for machine learning systems called semi-flexible prediction that lies between the classification task performed by decision tree algorithms and the flexible prediction task performed by conceptual clustering systems. In semi-flexible prediction, learning should improve prediction of a specific set of features known a priori rather than a single known feature (as in classification) or an arbitrary set of features (as in conceptual clustering). We describe one such task from natural language processing and present experiments that compare solutions to the problem using decision trees, CBL, and a hybrid approach that combines the two. In the hybrid approach, decision trees are used to specify the features to be included in k-nearest neighbor case retrieval. Results from the experiments show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the decision tree and case-based approaches as well as two case-based systems that incorporate expert knowledge into their case retrieval algorithms. Results clearly indicate that decision trees can be used to improve the performance of CBL systems and do so without reliance on potentially expensive expert knowledge.",0
"Title: Prosopagnosia in Modular Neural Network Models  
Abstract: There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing ""module"" could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified.

It shows how this approach provides a framework for acquiring flexible adaptation knowledge from experiences with autonomous adaptation and suggests its potential as a basis for acquisition of adaptation knowledge from interactive user guidance. It also presents initial experimental results examining the benefits of the approach and comparing the relative contributions of case learning and adaptation learning to reasoning performance. ",0
"Title: Learning Unions of Boxes with Membership and Equivalence Queries  
Abstract: We present two algorithms that use membership and equivalence queries to exactly identify the concepts given by the union of s discretized axis-parallel boxes in d-dimensional discretized Euclidean space where each coordinate can have n discrete values. The first algorithm receives at most sd counterexamples and uses time and membership queries polynomial in s and log n for d any constant. Further, all equivalence queries made can be formulated as the union of O(sd log s) axis-parallel boxes. Next, we introduce a new complexity measure that better captures the complexity of a union of boxes than simply the number of boxes and dimensions. Our new measure, , is the number of segments in the target polyhedron where a segment is a maximum portion of one of the sides of the polyhedron that lies entirely inside or entirely outside each of the other halfspaces defining the polyhedron. We then present an improvement of our first algorithm that uses time and queries polynomial in and log n. The hypothesis class used here is decision trees of height at most 2sd. Further we can show that the time and queries used by this algorithm are polynomial in d and log n for s any constant thus generalizing the exact learnability of DNF formulas with a constant number of terms. In fact, this single algorithm is efficient for either s or d constant. ","Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Derivation Replay in Partial-order vs State-space Planning  
Abstract: Case-based planning involves storing individual instances of problem-solving episodes and using them to tackle new planning problems. This paper is concerned with derivation replay, which is the main component of a form of case-based planning called derivational analogy (DA). Prior to this study, implementations of derivation replay have been based within state-space planning. We are motivated by the acknowledged superiority of partial-order (PO) planners in plan generation. Here we demonstrate that plan-space planning also has an advantage in replay. We will argue that the decoupling of planning (derivation) order and the execution order of plan steps, provided by partial-order planners, enables them to exploit the guidance of previous cases in a more efficient and straightforward fashion. We validate our hypothesis through a focused empirical comparison. ",0

For the first problem, the END model has been able to build from scratch some sorting networks as good as the best known for the 16-input problem. It even improved by one comparator a 25 years old result for the 13-input problem! For the Solitaire game, END evolved a strategy comparable to a human designed strategy. ",0
"Title: Feature Selection by Means of a Feature Weighting Approach  
Abstract: Selecting a set of features which is optimal for a given classification task is one of the central problems in machine learning. We address the problem using the flexible and robust filter technique EUBAFES. EUBAFES is based on a feature weighting approach which computes binary feature weights and therefore a solution in the feature selection sense and also gives detailed information about feature relevance by continuous weights. Moreover the user gets not only one but several potentially optimal feature subsets which is important for filter-based feature selection algorithms since it gives the flexibility to use even complex classifiers by the application of a combined filter/wrapper approach. We applied EUBAFES on a number of artificial and real world data sets and used radial basis function networks to examine the impact of the feature subsets to classifier accuracy and complexity.","Title: Composite Geometric Concepts and Polynomial Predictability  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate representational and methodological issues in a attractor network model of the mapping from orthography to semantics based on [Plaut, 1995]. We find that, contrary to psycholinguistic studies, the response time to concrete words (represented by more 1 bits in the output pattern) is slower than for abstract words. This model also predicts that response times to words in a dense semantic neighborhood will be faster than words which have few semantically similar neighbors in the language. This is conceptually consistent with the neighborhood effect seen in the mapping from orthography to phonology [Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989, Plaut et al., 1996] in that patterns with many neighbors are faster in both pathways, but since there is no regularity in the random mapping used here, it is clear that the cause of this effect is different than that of previous experiments. We also report a rather distressing finding. Reaction time in this model is measured by the time it takes the network to settle after being presented with a new input. When the criterion used to determine when the network is settled is changed to include testing of the hidden units, each of the results reported above change the direction of effect abstract words are now slower, as are words in dense semantic neighborhoods. Since there are independent reasons to exclude hidden units from the stopping criterion, and this is what is done in common practice, we believe this phenomenon to be of interest mostly to neural network practitioners. However, it does provide some insight into the interaction between the hidden and output units during settling. ",0

Abstract: We have evolved artificial neural networks to control the wandering behavior of small robots. The task was to touch as many squares in a grid as possible during a fixed period of time. A number of the simulated robots were embodied in small Lego (Trademark) robot, controlled by a Motorola (Trademark) 6811 processor; and their performance was compared to the simulations. We observed that: (a) evolution was an effective means to program control; (b) progress was characterized by sharply stepped periods of improvement, separated by periods of stasis that corresponded to levels of behavioral/computational complexity; and (c) the simulated and realized robots behaved quite similarly, the realized robots in some cases outperforming the simulated ones. Introducing random noise to the simulations improved the fit somewhat (from 0.73 to 0.79). Hybrid simulated/embodied selection regimes for evolutionary robots are discussed. ",0

"Title: Dynamic Automatic Model Selection  
Abstract: COINS Technical Report 92-30 February 1992 Abstract The problem of how to learn from examples has been studied throughout the history of machine learning, and many successful learning algorithms have been developed. A problem that has received less attention is how to select which algorithm to use for a given learning task. The ability of a chosen algorithm to induce a good generalization depends on how appropriate the model class underlying the algorithm is for the given task. We define an algorithm's model class to be the representation language it uses to express a generalization of the examples. Supervised learning algorithms differ in their underlying model class and in how they search for a good generalization. Given this characterization, it is not surprising that some algorithms find better generalizations for some, but not all tasks. Therefore, in order to find the best generalization for each task, an automated learning system must search for the appropriate model class in addition to searching for the best generalization within the chosen class. This thesis proposal investigates the issues involved in automating the selection of the appropriate model class. The presented approach has two facets. Firstly, the approach combines different model classes in the form of a model combination decision tree, which allows the best representation to be found for each subconcept of the learning task. Secondly, which model class is the most appropriate is determined dynamically using a set of heuristic rules. Explicit in each rule are the conditions in which a particular model class is appropriate and if it is not, what should be done next. In addition to describing the approach, this proposal describes how the approach will be evaluated in order to demonstrate that it is both an efficient and effective method for automatic model selection.

Abstract: Selecting a good model of a set of input points by cross validation is a computationally intensive process, especially if the number of possible models or the number of training points is high. Techniques such as gradient descent are helpful in searching through the space of models, but problems such as local minima, and more importantly, lack of a distance metric between various models reduce the applicability of these search methods. Hoeffding Races is a technique for finding a good model for the data by quickly discarding bad models, and concentrating the computational effort at differentiating between the better ones. This paper focuses on the special case of leave-one-out cross validation applied to memory-based learning algorithms, but we also argue that it is applicable to any class of model selection problems.

"Title: Minimum-Perimeter Domain Assignment  
Abstract: For certain classes of problems defined over two-dimensional domains with grid structure, optimization problems involving the assignment of grid cells to processors present a nonlinear network model for the problem of partitioning tasks among processors so as to minimize interprocessor communication. Minimizing interprocessor communication in this context is shown to be equivalent to tiling the domain so as to minimize total tile perimeter, where each tile corresponds to the collection of tasks assigned to some processor. A tight lower bound on the perimeter of a tile as a function of its area is developed. We then show how to generate minimum-perimeter tiles. By using assignments corresponding to near-rectangular minimum-perimeter tiles, closed form solutions are developed for certain classes of domains. We conclude with computational results with parallel high-level genetic algorithms that have produced good (and sometimes provably optimal) solutions for very large perimeter minimization problems.","Title: Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications  
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration.",0

Abstract: We present results for three new algorithms for setting the step-size parameters, ff and , of temporal-difference learning methods such as TD(). The overall task is that of learning to predict the outcome of an unknown Markov chain based on repeated observations of its state trajectories. The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods. We compare our algorithms with conventional Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods have a natural way of setting the step size: for each state s they use a step size of 1=n s , where n s is the number of times state s has been visited. We seek and come close to achieving comparable step-size algorithms for TD(). One new algorithm uses a = 1=n s schedule to achieve the same effect as processing a state backwards with TD(0), but remains completely incremental. Another algorithm uses a at each time equal to the estimated transition probability of the current transition. We present empirical results showing improvement in convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods and conventional TD(). A limitation of our results at present is that they apply only to tasks whose state trajectories do not contain cycles. ","Title: Guiding or Hiding: Explorations into the Effects of Learning on the Rate of Evolution.  
Abstract: Individual lifetime learning can `guide' an evolving population to areas of high fitness in genotype space through an evolutionary phenomenon known as the Baldwin effect (Baldwin, 1896; Hin-ton & Nowlan, 1987). It is the accepted wisdom that this guiding speeds up the rate of evolution. By highlighting another interaction between learning and evolution, that will be termed the Hiding effect, it will be argued here that this depends on the measure of evolutionary speed one adopts. The Hiding effect shows that learning can reduce the selection pressure between individuals by `hiding' their genetic differences. There is thus a trade-off between the Baldwin effect and the Hiding effect to determine learning's influence on evolution and two factors that contribute to this trade-off, the cost of learning and landscape epis tasis, are investigated experimentally.",0
"Title: Q-Learning for Bandit Problems  
Abstract: Multi-armed bandits may be viewed as decompositionally-structured Markov decision processes (MDP's) with potentially very-large state sets. A particularly elegant methodology for computing optimal policies was developed over twenty ago by Gittins [Gittins & Jones, 1974]. Gittins' approach reduces the problem of finding optimal policies for the original MDP to a sequence of low-dimensional stopping problems whose solutions determine the optimal policy through the so-called ""Gittins indices."" Katehakis and Veinott [Katehakis & Veinott, 1987] have shown that the Gittins index for a process in state i may be interpreted as a particular component of the maximum-value function associated with the ""restart-in-i"" process, a simple MDP to which standard solution methods for computing optimal policies, such as successive approximation, apply. This paper explores the problem of learning the Git-tins indices on-line without the aid of a process model; it suggests utilizing process-state-specific Q-learning agents to solve their respective restart-in-state-i subproblems, and includes an example in which the online reinforcement learning approach is applied to a problem of stochastic scheduling|one instance drawn from a wide class of problems that may be formulated as bandit problems.","Title: Rule Generation and Compaction in the wwtp

LINNEO + 's output, a representation of the conceptual structure of the domain in terms of classes, is the input to GAR that is used to generate a set of classification rules for the original training set. GAR can generate both conjunctive and disjunctive rules. Herein we present an application of these techniques to data obtained from a real wastewater treatment plant in order to help the construction of a rule base. This rule will be used for a knowledge-based system that aims to supervise the whole process. ",0
"Title: Figure 1: The architecture of a Kohonen network. Each input neuron is fully connected with
Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the mistake-bound model (for learning f0; 1g-valued functions) in which the learner must satisfy a general constraint on the number M + of incorrect 1 predictions and the number M of incorrect 0 predictions. We describe a general-purpose optimal algorithm for our formulation of this problem. We describe several applications of our general results, involving situations in which the learner wishes to satisfy linear inequalities in M + and M .","Title: A Classifier System plays a simple board game Getting down to the Basics of Machine Learning?  
Abstract: It is well known that standard learning classifier systems, when applied to many different domains, exhibit a number of problems: payoff oscillation, difficult to regulate interplay between the reward system and the background genetic algorithm (GA), rule chains instability, default hierarchies instability, are only a few. ALECSYS is a parallel version of a standard learning classifier system (CS), and as such suffers of these same problems. In this paper we propose some innovative solutions to some of these problems. We introduce the following original features. Mutespec, a new genetic operator used to specialize potentially useful classifiers. Energy, a quantity introduced to measure global convergence in order to apply the genetic algorithm only when the system is close to a steady state. Dynamical adjustment of the classifiers set cardinality, in order to speed up the performance phase of the algorithm. We present simulation results of experiments run in a simulated two-dimensional world in which a simple agent learns to follow a light source. ",0
"Title: An adaptation of Relief for attribute estimation in regression  
Abstract: Heuristic measures for estimating the quality of attributes mostly assume the independence of attributes so in domains with strong dependencies between attributes their performance is poor. Relief and its extension ReliefF are capable of correctly estimating the quality of attributes in classification problems with strong dependencies between attributes. By exploiting local information provided by different contexts they provide a global view. We present the analysis of Reli-efF which lead us to its adaptation to regression (continuous class) problems. The experiments on artificial and real-world data sets show that Re-gressional ReliefF correctly estimates the quality of attributes in various conditions, and can be used for non-myopic learning of the regression trees. Regressional ReliefF and ReliefF provide a unified view on estimating the attribute quality in regression and classification.","Title: Solving Combinatorial Optimization Tasks by Reinforcement Learning: A General Methodology Applied to Resource-Constrained Scheduling  
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for solving combinatorial optimization problems through the application of reinforcement learning methods. The approach can be applied in cases where several similar instances of a combinatorial optimization problem must be solved. The key idea is to analyze a set of ""training"" problem instances and learn a search control policy for solving new problem instances. The search control policy has the twin goals of finding high-quality solutions and finding them quickly. Results of applying this methodology to a NASA scheduling problem show that the learned search control policy is much more effective than the best known non-learning search procedure|a method based on simulated annealing.",0
"Title: Using Qualitative Relationships for Bounding Probability Distributions  
Abstract: We exploit qualitative probabilistic relationships among variables for computing bounds of conditional probability distributions of interest in Bayesian networks. Using the signs of qualitative relationships, we can implement abstraction operations that are guaranteed to bound the distributions of interest in the desired direction. By evaluating incrementally improved approximate networks, our algorithm obtains monotonically tightening bounds that converge to exact distributions. For supermodular utility functions, the tightening bounds monotonically reduce the set of admissible decision alternatives as well. ","Title: Improved Boosting Algorithms Using Confidence-rated Predictions  
Abstract: We describe several improvements to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost boosting algorithm, particularly in a setting in which hypotheses may assign confidences to each of their predictions. We give a simplified analysis of AdaBoost in this setting, and we show how this analysis can be used to find improved parameter settings as well as a refined criterion for training weak hypotheses. We give a specific method for assigning confidences to the predictions of decision trees, a method closely related to one used by Quinlan. This method also suggests a technique for growing decision trees which turns out to be identical to one proposed by Kearns and Mansour. We focus next on how to apply the new boosting algorithms to multiclass classification problems, particularly to the multi-label case in which each example may belong to more than one class. We give two boosting methods for this problem. One of these leads to a new method for handling the single-label case which is simpler but as effective as techniques suggested by Freund and Schapire. Finally, we give some experimental results comparing a few of the algorithms discussed in this paper. ",0
"Title: Measuring the Difficulty of Specific Learning Problems  
Abstract: Existing complexity measures from contemporary learning theory cannot be conveniently applied to specific learning problems (e.g., training sets). Moreover, they are typically non-generic, i.e., they necessitate making assumptions about the way in which the learner will operate. The lack of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which is associated with computational tractability. By determining which class a particular problem belongs to, we can thus effectively evaluate its degree of generic difficulty. ","Title: Price's Theorem and the MAX Problem  
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the evolution of GP populations using the problem of finding a program which returns the maximum possible value for a given terminal and function set and a depth limit on the program tree (known as the MAX problem). We confirm the basic message of [ Gathercole and Ross, 1996 ] that crossover together with program size restrictions can be responsible for premature convergence to a sub-optimal solution. We show that this can happen even when the population retains a high level of variety and show that in many cases evolution from the sub-optimal solution to the solution is possible if sufficient time is allowed. In both cases theoretical models are presented and compared with actual runs. Experimental evidence is presented that Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem can be applied to GP populations and the practical effect of program size restrictions are noted. Finally we show that covariance between gene frequency and fitness in the first few generations can be used to predict the course of GP runs.",0
"Title: PAC Learning of One-Dimensional Patterns  
Abstract: Developing the ability to recognize a landmark from a visual image of a robot's current location is a fundamental problem in robotics. We consider the problem of PAC-learning the concept class of geometric patterns where the target geometric pattern is a configuration of k points on the real line. Each instance is a configuration of n points on the real line, where it is labeled according to whether or not it visually resembles the target pattern. To capture the notion of visual resemblance we use the Hausdorff metric. Informally, two geometric patterns P and Q resemble each other under the Hausdorff metric, if every point on one pattern is ""close"" to some point on the other pattern. We relate the concept class of geometric patterns to the landmark recognition problem and then present a polynomial-time algorithm that PAC-learns the class of one-dimensional geometric patterns. We also present some experimental results on how our algorithm performs. ","Title: POWER OF NEURAL NETS  
Abstract: Report SYCON-91-11 ABSTRACT This paper deals with the simulation of Turing machines by neural networks. Such networks are made up of interconnections of synchronously evolving processors, each of which updates its state according to a ""sigmoidal"" linear combination of the previous states of all units. The main result states that one may simulate all Turing machines by nets, in linear time. In particular, it is possible to give a net made up of about 1,000 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function. (This is an update of Report SYCON-91-08; new results include the simulation in linear time of binary-tape machines, as opposed to the unary alphabets used in the previous version.) ",0

"Title: Lessons in Neural Network Training: Overfitting Lessons in Neural Network Training: Overfitting May be Harder
Abstract: For many reasons, neural networks have become very popular AI machine learning models. Two of the most important aspects of machine learning models are how well the model generalizes to unseen data, and how well the model scales with problem complexity. Using a controlled task with known optimal training error, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. We find that the optimal solution is typically not found. Furthermore, we observe that networks larger than might be expected can result in lower training and generalization error. This result is supported by another real world example. We further investigate the training behavior by analyzing the weights in trained networks (excess degrees of freedom are seen to do little harm and to aid convergence), and contrasting the interpolation characteristics of multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPs) and polynomial models (overfitting behavior is very different the MLP is often biased towards smoother solutions). Finally, we analyze relevant theory outlining the reasons for significant practical differences. These results bring into question common beliefs about neural network training regarding convergence and optimal network size, suggest alternate guidelines for practical use (lower fear of excess degrees of freedom), and help to direct future work (e.g. methods for creation of more parsimonious solutions, importance of the MLP/BP bias and possibly worse performance of improved training algorithms). ","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines  Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  
Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

"Title: Decision Tree Induction: How Effective is the Greedy Heuristic?  
Abstract: Most existing decision tree systems use a greedy approach to induce trees | locally optimal splits are induced at every node of the tree. Although the greedy approach is suboptimal, it is believed to produce reasonably good trees. In the current work, we attempt to verify this belief. We quantify the goodness of greedy tree induction empirically, using the popular decision tree algorithms, C4.5 and CART. We induce decision trees on thousands of synthetic data sets and compare them to the corresponding optimal trees, which in turn are found using a novel map coloring idea. We measure the effect on greedy induction of variables such as the underlying concept complexity, training set size, noise and dimensionality. Our experiments show, among other things, that the expected classification cost of a greedily induced tree is consistently very close to that of the optimal tree. ","Title: Discretization of continuous Markov chains and MCMC convergence assessment  
Abstract: We show in this paper that continuous state space Markov chains can be rigorously discretized into finite Markov chains. The idea is to subsample the continuous chain at renewal times related to small sets which control the discretization. Once a finite Markov chain is derived from the MCMC output, general convergence properties on finite state spaces can be exploited for convergence assessment in several directions. Our choice is based on a divergence criterion derived from Kemeny and Snell (1960), which is first evaluated on parallel chains with a stopping time, and then implemented, more efficiently, on two parallel chains only, using Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem for stopping rules. The performance of this criterion is illustrated on three standard examples. ",0
"Title: Using a Genetic Algorithm to Learn Strategies for Collision Avoidance and Local Navigation  
Abstract: Navigation through obstacles such as mine fields is an important capability for autonomous underwater vehicles. One way to produce robust behavior is to perform projective planning. However, real-time performance is a critical requirement in navigation. What is needed for a truly autonomous vehicle are robust reactive rules that perform well in a wide variety of situations, and that also achieve real-time performance. In this work, SAMUEL, a learning system based on genetic algorithms, is used to learn high-performance reactive strategies for navigation and collision avoidance. ","Title: On Learning Bounded-Width Branching Programs  
Abstract: In this paper, we study PAC-learning algorithms for specialized classes of deterministic finite automata (DFA). In particular, we study branching programs, and we investigate the influence of the width of the branching program on the difficulty of the learning problem. We first present a distribution-free algorithm for learning width-2 branching programs. We also give an algorithm for the proper learning of width-2 branching programs under uniform distribution on labeled samples. We then show that the existence of an efficient algorithm for learning width-3 branching programs would imply the existence of an efficient algorithm for learning DNF, which is not known to be the case. Finally, we show that the existence of an algorithm for learning width-3 branching programs would also yield an algorithm for learning a very restricted version of parity with noise.",0

"Title: Dynamical Selection of Learning Algorithms  
Abstract: Determining the conditions for which a given learning algorithm is appropriate is an open problem in machine learning. Methods for selecting a learning algorithm for a given domain have met with limited success. This paper proposes a new approach to predicting a given example's class by locating it in the ""example space"" and then choosing the best learner(s) in that region of the example space to make predictions. The regions of the example space are defined by the prediction patterns of the learners being used. The learner(s) chosen for prediction are selected according to their past performance in that region. This dynamic approach to learning algorithm selection is compared to other methods for selecting from multiple learning algorithms. The approach is then extended to weight rather than select the algorithms according to their past performance in a given region. Both approaches are further evaluated on a set of Determining the conditions for which a given learning algorithm is appropriate is an open problem in machine learning. Methods for selecting a learning algorithm for a given domain (e.g. [Aha92, Breiman84]) or for a portion of the domain ([Brodley93, Brodley94]) have met with limited success. This paper proposes a new approach that dynamically selects a learning algorithm for each example by locating it in the ""example space"" and then choosing the best learner(s) for prediction in that part of the example space. The regions of the example space are formed by the observed prediction patterns of the learners being used. The learner(s) chosen for prediction are selected according to their past performance in that region which is defined by the ""cross-validation history."" This paper introduces DS, a method for the dynamic selection of a learning algorithm(s). We call it ""dynamic"" because the learning algorithm(s) used to classify a novel example depends on that example. Preliminary experimentation motivated DW, an extension to DS that dynamically weights the learners predictions according to their regional accuracy. Further experimentation compares DS and DW to a collection of other meta-learning strategies such as cross-validation ([Breiman84]) and various forms of stacking ([Wolpert92]). In this phase of the experiementation, the meta-learners have six constituent learners which are heterogeneous in their search and representation methods (e.g. a rule learner, CN2 [Clark89]; a decision tree learner, C4.5 [Quinlan93]; an oblique decision tree learner, OC1 [Murthy93]; an instance-based learner, PEBLS [Cost93]; a k-nearest neighbor learner, ten domains and compared to several other meta-learning strategies.","Title: Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis

We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss the advantages conveyed by the definition of a probability density function for PCA.

The preliminary results indicate that the method produces simple trees that generalize well with respect to other decision tree algorithms and single support vector machines.","Title: Multiple Network Systems (Minos) Modules: Task Division and Module Discrimination 1  
Abstract: It is widely considered an ultimate connectionist objective to incorporate neural networks into intelligent systems. These systems are intended to possess a varied repertoire of functions enabling adaptable interaction with a non-static environment. The first step in this direction is to develop various neural network algorithms and models, the second step is to combine such networks into a modular structure that might be incorporated into a workable system. In this paper we consider one aspect of the second point, namely: processing reliability and hiding of wetware details. Pre- sented is an architecture for a type of neural expert module, named an Authority. An Authority consists of a number of Minos modules. Each of the Minos modules in an Authority has the same processing capabilities, but varies with respect to its particular specialization to aspects of the problem domain. The Authority employs the collection of Minoses like a panel of experts. The expert with the highest confidence is believed, and it is the answer and confidence quotient that are transmitted to other levels in a system hierarchy. ",0
"Title: The Automatic Programming of Agents that Learn Mental Models and Create Simple Plans of Action  
Abstract: An essential component of an intelligent agent is the ability to notice, encode, store, and utilize information about its environment. Traditional approaches to program induction have focused on evolving functional or reactive programs. This paper presents MAPMAKER, an approach to the automatic generation of agents that discover information about their environment, encode this information for later use, and create simple plans utilizing the stored mental models. In this approach, agents are multipart computer programs that communicate through a shared memory. Both the programs and the representation scheme are evolved using genetic programming. An illustrative problem of 'gold' collection is used to demonstrate the approach in which one part of a program makes a map of the world and stores it in memory, and the other part uses this map to find the gold The results indicate that the approach can evolve programs that store simple representations of their environments and use these representations to produce simple plans. 1. Introduction ","Title: SELF-ORGANIZING PROCESS BASED ON LATERAL INHIBITION AND SYNAPTIC RESOURCE REDISTRIBUTION  
Abstract: Self-organizing feature maps are usually implemented by abstracting the low-level neural and parallel distributed processes. An external supervisor finds the unit whose weight vector is closest in Euclidian distance to the input vector and determines the neighborhood for weight adaptation. The weights are changed proportional to the Euclidian distance. In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved. It is also necessary to add a redundant dimension to the input vectors.",0

","Title: Specialization under Social Conditions in Shared Environments  
Abstract: Specialist and generalist behaviors in populations of artificial neural networks are studied. A genetic algorithm is used to simulate evolution processes, and thereby to develop neural network control systems that exhibit specialist or generalist behaviors according to the fitness formula. With evolvable fitness formulae the evaluation measure is let free to evolve, and we obtain a co-evolution of the expressed behavior and the individual evolvable fitness formula. The use of evolvable fitness formulae lets us work in a dynamic fitness landscape, opposed to most work, that traditionally applies to static fitness landscapes, only. The role of competition in specialization is studied by letting the individuals live under social conditions in the same, shared environment and directly compete with each other. We find, that competition can act to provide population diversification in populations of organisms with individual evolvable fitness formulae.",0
"Title: PRONOUNCING NAMES BY A COMBINATION OF RULE-BASED AND CASE-BASED REASONING  
Abstract: We describe the design and tuning of a controller for enforcing compliance with a prescribed velocity profile for a rail-based transportation system. This requires following a trajectory, rather than fixed set-points (as in automobiles). We synthesize a fuzzy controller for tracking the velocity profile, while providing a smooth ride and staying within the prescribed speed limits. We use a genetic algorithm to tune the fuzzy controller's performance by adjusting its parameters (the scaling factors and the membership functions) in a sequential order of significance. We show that this approach results in a controller that is superior to the manually designed one, and with only modest computational effort. This makes it possible to customize automated tuning to a variety of different configurations of the route, the terrain, the power configuration, and the cargo. ","Title: Metrics for Temporal Difference Learning  
Abstract: For an absorbing Markov chain with a reinforcement on each transition, Bertsekas (1995a) gives a simple example where the function learned by TD( ll ) depends on ll . Bertsekas showed that for ll =1 the approximation is optimal with respect to a least-squares error of the value function, and that for ll =0 the approximation obtained by the TD method is poor with respect to the same metric. With respect to the error in the values, TD(1) approximates the function better than TD(0). However, with respect to the error in the differences in the values, TD(0) approximates the function better than TD(1). TD(1) is only better than TD(0) with respect to the former metric rather than the latter. In addition, direct TD( ll ) weights the errors unequally, while residual gradient methods (Baird, 1995, Harmon, Baird, & Klopf, 1995) weight the errors equally. For the case of control, a simple Markov decision process is presented for which direct TD(0) and residual gradient TD(0) both learn the optimal policy, while TD( 11 ) learns a suboptimal policy. These results suggest that, for this example, the differences in state values are more significant than the state values themselves, so TD(0) is preferable to TD(1). ",0
"Title: On Step-Size and Bias in Temporal-Difference Learning  
Abstract: We present results for three new algorithms for setting the step-size parameters, ff and , of temporal-difference learning methods such as TD(). The overall task is that of learning to predict the outcome of an unknown Markov chain based on repeated observations of its state trajectories. The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods. We compare our algorithms with conventional Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo methods have a natural way of setting the step size: for each state s they use a step size of 1=n s , where n s is the number of times state s has been visited. We seek and come close to achieving comparable step-size algorithms for TD(). One new algorithm uses a = 1=n s schedule to achieve the same effect as processing a state backwards with TD(0), but remains completely incremental. Another algorithm uses a at each time equal to the estimated transition probability of the current transition. We present empirical results showing improvement in convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods and conventional TD(). A limitation of our results at present is that they apply only to tasks whose state trajectories do not contain cycles. ","Title: Graph Coloring with Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms  
Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on solving graph coloring problems with Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). After testing different algorithm variants we conclude that the best option is an asexual EA using order-based representation and an adaptation mechanism that periodically changes the fitness function during the evolution. This adaptive EA is general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping GA on a wide range of problem instances with different size, topology and edge density. The results show that the adaptive EA is superior to the Grouping GA and outperforms DSatur on the hardest problem instances. Furthermore, it scales up better with the problem size than the other two algorithms and indicates a linear computational complexity. ",0
"Title: A Hierarchical Latent Variable Model for Data Visualization  
Abstract: Visualization has proven to be a powerful and widely-applicable tool for the analysis and interpretation of multi-variate data. Most visualization algorithms aim to find a projection from the data space down to a two-dimensional visualization space. However, for complex data sets living in a high-dimensional space it is unlikely that a single two-dimensional projection can reveal all of the interesting structure. We therefore introduce a hierarchical visualization algorithm which allows the complete data set to be visualized at the top level, with clusters and sub-clusters of data points visualized at deeper levels. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical mixture of latent variable models, whose parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a toy data set, and we then apply the algorithm to the visualization of a synthetic data set in 12 dimensions obtained from a simulation of multi-phase flows in oil pipelines, and to data in 36 dimensions derived from satellite images. A Matlab software implementation of the algorithm is publicly available from the world-wide web. ","Title: Learning networks for face analysis and synthesis

Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. ",0

Abstract: The effectiveness of a case-based reasoning system is known to depend critically on its similarity measure. However, it is not clear whether there are elusive and esoteric similarity measures which might improve the performance of a case-based reasoner if substituted for the more commonly used measures. This paper therefore deals with the problem of choosing the best similarity measure, in the limited context of instance-based learning of classifications of a discrete example space. We consider both `fixed' similarity measures and `learnt' ones. In the former case, we give a definition of a similarity measure which we believe to be `optimal' w.r.t. the current prior distribution of target concepts and prove its optimality within a restricted class of similarity measures. We then show how this `optimal' similarity measure is instantiated by some specific prior distributions, and conclude that a very simple similarity measure is as good as any other in these cases.

Abstract: The structure of the fitness landscape on which genetic programming operates is examined. The landscapes of a range of problems of known difficulty are analyzed in an attempt to determine which landscape measures correlate with the difficulty of the problem. The autocorrelation of the fitness values of random walks, a measure which has been shown to be related to perceived difficulty using other techniques, is only a weak indicator of the difficulty as perceived by genetic programming. All of these problems show unusually low autocorrelation. Comparison of the range of landscape basin depths at the end of adaptive walks on the landscapes shows good correlation with problem difficulty, over the entire range of problems examined.

"Title: Submitted to Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing Neural Network Constructive Algorithms: Trading Generalization for Learning Efficiency?  
Abstract: There are currently several types of constructive, or growth, algorithms available for training a feed-forward neural network. This paper describes and explains the main ones, using a fundamental approach to the multi-layer perceptron problem-solving mechanisms. The claimed convergence properties of the algorithms are verified using just two mapping theorems, which consequently enables all the algorithms to be unified under a basic mechanism. The algorithms are compared and contrasted and the deficiencies of some highlighted. The fundamental reasons for the actual success of these algorithms are extracted, and used to suggest where they might most fruitfully be applied. A suspicion that they are not a panacea for all current neural network difficulties, and that one must somewhere along the line pay for the learning efficiency they promise, is developed into an argument that their generalization abilities will lie on average below that of back-propagation. ","Title: Extraction of Meta-Knowledge to Restrict the Hypothesis Space for ILP Systems incorporating them in FOIL.
Abstract: Many ILP systems, such as GOLEM, FOIL, and MIS, take advantage of user supplied meta-knowledge to restrict the hypothesis space. This meta-knowledge can be in the form of type information about arguments in the predicate being learned, or it can be information about whether a certain argument in the predicate is functionally dependent on the other arguments (supplied as mode information). This meta knowledge is explicitly supplied to an ILP system in addition to the data. The present paper argues that in many cases the meta knowledge can be extracted directly from the raw data. Three algorithms are presented that learn type, mode, and symmetric meta-knowledge from data. These algorithms can be incorporated in existing ILP systems in the form of a preprocessor that obviates the need for a user to explicitly provide this information. In many cases, the algorithms can extract meta- knowledge that the user is either unaware of, but which information can be used by the ILP system to restrict the hypothesis space. ",0
"Title: Growing Layers of Perceptrons: Introducing the Extentron Algorithm  
Abstract: vations of perceptrons: (1) when the perceptron learning algorithm cycles among hyperplanes, the hyperplanes may be compared to select one that gives a best split of the examples, and (2) it is always possible for the perceptron to build a hyper- plane that separates at least one example from all the rest. We describe the Extentron which grows multi-layer networks capable of distinguishing non- linearly-separable data using the simple perceptron rule for linear threshold units. The resulting algorithm is simple, very fast, scales well to large prob - lems, retains the convergence properties of the perceptron, and can be completely specified using only two parameters. Results are presented comparing the Extentron to other neural network paradigms and to symbolic learning systems. ","Title: Investigating the role of diploidy in simulated populations of evolving individuals  
Abstract: In most work applying genetic algorithms to populations of neural networks there is no real distinction between genotype and phenotype. In nature both the information contained in the genotype and the mapping of the genetic information into the phenotype are usually much more complex. The genotypes of many organisms exhibit diploidy, i.e., they include two copies of each gene: if the two copies are not identical in their sequences and therefore have a functional difference in their products (usually proteins), the expressed phenotypic feature is termed the dominant one, the other one recessive (not expressed). In this paper we review the literature on the use of diploidy and dominance operators in genetic algorithms; we present the new results we obtained with our own simulations in changing environments; finally, we discuss some results of our simulations that parallel biological findings.",0
"Title: Analyzing GAs Using Markov Models with Semantically Ordered and Lumped States  
Abstract: At the previous FOGA workshop, we presented some initial results on using Markov models to analyze the transient behavior of genetic algorithms (GAs) being used as function optimizers (GAFOs). In that paper, the states of the Markov model were ordered via a simple and mathematically convenient lexicographic ordering used initially by Nix and Vose. In this paper, we explore alternative orderings of states based on interesting semantic properties such as average fitness, degree of homogeneity, average attractive force, etc. We also explore lumping techniques for reducing the size of the state space. Analysis of these reordered and lumped Markov models provides new insights into the transient behavior of GAs in general and GAFOs in particular.","Title: Framework for Combining Symbolic and Neural Learning rule extraction from neural networks the KBANN algorithm

"Title: LOCAL ADAPTIVE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR BLIND SEPARATION OF NATURAL IMAGES  
Abstract: In this paper a neural network approach for reconstruction of natural highly correlated images from linear (additive) mixture of them is proposed. A multi-layer architecture with local on-line learning rules is developed to solve the problem of blind separation of sources. The main motivation for using a multi-layer network instead of a single-layer one is to improve the performance and robustness of separation, while applying a very simple local learning rule, which is biologically plausible. Moreover such architecture with on-chip learning is relatively easy implementable using VLSI electronic circuits. Furthermore it enables the extraction of source signals sequentially one after the other, starting from the strongest signal and finishing with the weakest one. The experimental part focuses on separating highly correlated human faces from mixture of them, with additive noise and under unknown number of sources. ","Title: Competitive Environments Evolve Better Solutions for Complex Tasks  
Abstract: University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Technical Report 876 (September 1989) Abstract In explanation-based learning, a specific problem's solution is generalized into a form that can be later used to solve conceptually similar problems. Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning. ",0
"Title: Problem Solving for Redesign  
Abstract: A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign and developed a task-method structure for redesign. In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a problem-solving method, and the decomposition of a problem-solving method into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest to extend these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to its operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a more piecemeal fashion.

"Title: The Disk-Covering Method for Tree Reconstruction  
Abstract: Evolutionary tree reconstruction is a very important step in many biological research problems, and yet is extremely difficult for a variety of computational, statistical, and scientific reasons. In particular, the reconstruction of very large trees containing significant amounts of divergence is especially challenging. We present in this paper a new tree reconstruction method, which we call the Disk-Covering Method, which can be used to recover accurate estimations of the evolutionary tree for otherwise intractable datasets. DCM obtains a decomposition of the input dataset into small overlapping sets of closely related taxa, reconstructs trees on these subsets (using a ""base"" phylogenetic method of choice), and then combines the subtrees into one tree on the entire set of taxa. Because the subproblems analyzed by DCM are smaller, com-putationally expensive methods such as maximum likelihood estimation can be used without incurring too much cost. At the same time, because the taxa within each subset are closely related, even very simple methods (such as neighbor-joining) are much more likely to be highly accurate. The result is that DCM-boosted methods are typically faster and more accurate as compared to ""naive"" use of the same method. In this paper we describe the basic ideas and techniques in DCM, and demonstrate the advantages of DCM experimentally by simulating sequence evolution on a variety of trees.","Title: Machine Learning Research: Four Current Directions

","Title: Maximum A Posteriori Classification of DNA Structure from Sequence Information  
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm, lllama, which combines simple pattern recognizers into a general method for estimating the entropy of a sequence. Each pattern recognizer exploits a partial match between subsequences to build a model of the sequence. Since the primary features of interest in biological sequence domains are subsequences with small variations in exact composition, lllama is particularly suited to such domains. We describe two methods, lllama-length and lllama-alone, which use this entropy estimate to perform maximum a posteriori classification. We apply these methods to several problems in three-dimensional structure classification of short DNA sequences. The results include a surprisingly low 3.6% error rate in predicting helical conformation of oligonucleotides. We compare our results to those obtained using more traditional methods for automated generation of classifiers.",0

Each bag may contain many instances, but a bag is labeled positive even if only one of the instances in it falls within the concept. A bag is labeled negative only if all the instances in it are negative. We describe a new general framework, called Diverse Density, for solving multiple-instance learning problems.

In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree.",0
"Title: Convergence in Norm for Alternating Expectation-Maximization (EM) Type Algorithms 1  
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition for convergence of a general class of alternating estimation-maximization (EM) type continuous-parameter estimation algorithms with respect to a given norm. This class includes EM, penalized EM, Green's OSL-EM, and other approximate EM algorithms. The convergence analysis can be extended to include alternating coordinate-maximization EM algorithms such as Meng and Rubin's ECM and Fessler and Hero's SAGE. The condition for monotone convergence can be used to establish norms under which the distance between successive iterates and the limit point of the EM-type algorithm approaches zero monotonically. For illustration, we apply our results to estimation of Poisson rate parameters in emission tomography and establish that in the final iterations the logarithm of the EM iterates converge monotonically in a weighted Euclidean norm. ","Title: Data Exploration with Reflective Adaptive Models  
Abstract: Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner dersnlp+ebl. der-snlp+ebl extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.",0
"Title: A New Approach for Induction: From a Non-Axiomatic Logical Point of View  
Abstract: Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) is designed to be a general-purpose intelligent reasoning system, which is adaptive and works under insufficient knowledge and resources. This paper focuses on the components of NARS that contribute to the system's induction capacity, and shows how the traditional problems in induction are addressed by the system. The NARS approach of induction uses an term-oriented formal language with an experience-grounded semantics that consistently interprets various types of uncertainty. An induction rule generates conclusions from common instance of terms, and a revision rule combines evidence from different sources. In NARS, induction and other types of inference, such as deduction and abduction, are based on the same semantic foundation, and they cooperate in inference activities of the system. The system's control mechanism makes knowledge-driven, context-dependent inference possible.","Title: Some Biases for Efficient Learning of Spatial, Temporal, and Spatio-Temporal Patterns

It examines learning mechanisms that constructively build up network structures that encode information from environmental stimuli at successively higher resolutions as needed for the tasks (e.g., perceptual recognition) that the network has to perform. Some simple examples are presented to illustrate the the basic structures and processes used in such networks to ensure the parsimony of learned representations by guiding the system to focus its efforts at the minimal adequate resolution. Several extensions of the basic algorithm for efficient learning using multi-resolution representations of spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns are discussed. ",0
"Title: Building Classifiers using Bayesian Networks  
Abstract: Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state of the art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we examine and evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on recent results in the theory of learning Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayes classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness which are characteristic of naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches using benchmark problems from the U. C. Irvine repository, and compared them against C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper-based feature selection methods. ","Title: A Transformation System for Interactive Reformulation of Design Optimization Strategies  
Abstract: Numerical design optimization algorithms are highly sensitive to the particular formulation of the optimization problems they are given. The formulation of the search space, the objective function and the constraints will generally have a large impact on the duration of the optimization process as well as the quality of the resulting design. Furthermore, the best formulation will vary from one application domain to another, and from one problem to another within a given application domain. Unfortunately, a design engineer may not know the best formulation in advance of attempting to set up and run a design optimization process. In order to attack this problem, we have developed a software environment that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system represents optimization strategies in terms of second-order dataflow graphs. Reformulations of strategies are implemented as transformations between dataflow graphs. The system permits the user to interactively generate and search a space of design optimization strategies, and experimentally evaluate their performance on test problems, in order to find a strategy that is suitable for his application domain. The system has been implemented in a domain independent fashion, and is being tested in the domain of racing yacht design. ",0

The algorithm is based on minimizing an error function associated with a set of highly structured linear inequalities.

The error function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient that allows the use of fast serial and parallel unconstrained minimization algorithms. A serial quasi-Newton algorithm is considerably faster than previous linear programming formulations. A parallel gradient distribution algorithm is used to parallelize the error-minimization problem.

Abstract: This paper considers an aspect of mixture modelling. Significantly overlapping distributions require more data for their parameters to be accurately estimated than well separated distributions. For example, two Gaussian distributions are considered to significantly overlap when their means are within three standard deviations of each other. If insufficient data is available, only a single component distribution will be estimated, although the data originates from two component distributions. We consider how much data is required to distinguish two component distributions from one distribution in mixture modelling using the minimum message length (MML) criterion. First, we perform experiments which show the MML criterion performs well relative to other Bayesian criteria. Second, we make two improvements to the existing MML estimates, that improve its performance with overlapping distributions. ",0
"Title: DISCOVERING NEURAL NETS WITH LOW KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY AND HIGH GENERALIZATION CAPABILITY Neural Networks 10(5):857-873, 1997  
Abstract: Many neural net learning algorithms aim at finding ""simple"" nets to explain training data. The expectation is: the ""simpler"" the networks, the better the generalization on test data (! Occam's razor). Previous implementations, however, use measures for ""simplicity"" that lack the power, universality and elegance of those based on Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff's algorithmic probability. Likewise, most previous approaches (especially those of the ""Bayesian"" kind) suffer from the problem of choosing appropriate priors. This paper addresses both issues. It first reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learning, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The universal prior leads to a probabilistic method for finding ""algorithmically simple"" problem solutions with high generalization capability. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. For a given problem, solution candidates are computed by efficient ""self-sizing"" programs that influence their own runtime and storage size. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the ""good"" programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data). Simulations focus on the task of discovering ""algorithmically simple"" neural networks with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability. It is demonstrated that the method, at least with certain toy problems where it is computationally feasible, can lead to generalization results unmatchable by previous neural net algorithms. Much remains do be done, however, to make large scale applications and ""incremental learning"" feasible.","Title: Understanding Musical Sound with Forward Models and Physical Models  
Abstract: This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for costsensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for costsensitive classification EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICETs search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.",0

Abstract: Up-propagation is an algorithm for inverting and learning neural network generative models. Sensory input is processed by inverting a model that generates patterns from hidden variables using top-down connections. The inversion process is iterative, utilizing a negative feedback loop that depends on an error signal propagated by bottom-up connections. The error signal is also used to learn the generative model from examples. The algorithm is benchmarked against principal component analysis in In his doctrine of unconscious inference, Helmholtz argued that perceptions are formed by the interaction of bottom-up sensory data with top-down expectations. According to one interpretation of this doctrine, perception is a procedure of sequential hypothesis testing. We propose a new algorithm, called up-propagation, that realizes this interpretation in layered neural networks. It uses top-down connections to generate hypotheses, and bottom-up connections to revise them. It is important to understand the difference between up-propagation and its ancestor, the backpropagation algorithm[1]. Backpropagation is a learning algorithm for recognition models. As shown in Figure 1a, bottom-up connections recognize patterns, while top-down connections propagate an error signal that is used to learn the recognition model. In contrast, up-propagation is an algorithm for inverting and learning generative models, as shown in Figure 1b. Top-down connections generate patterns from a set of hidden variables. Sensory input is processed by inverting the generative model, recovering hidden variables that could have generated the sensory data. This operation is called either pattern recognition or pattern analysis, depending on the meaning of the hidden variables. Inversion of the generative model is done iteratively, through a negative feedback loop driven by an error signal from the bottom-up connections. The error signal is also used for learning the connections experiments on images of handwritten digits.",0
"Title: Unifying Empirical and Explanation-Based Learning by Modeling the Utility of Learned Knowledge  
Abstract: The overfit problem in empirical learning and the utility problem in explanation-based learning describe a similar phenomenon: the degradation of performance due to an increase in the amount of learned knowledge. Plotting the performance of learned knowledge during the course of learning (the performance response) reveals a common trend for several learning methods. Modeling this trend allows a control system to constrain the amount of learned knowledge to achieve peak performance and avoid the general utility problem. Experiments evaluate a particular empirical model of the trend, and analysis of the learners derive several formal models. If, as evidence suggests, the general utility problem can be modeled using the same mechanisms for different learning paradigms, then the model serves to unify the paradigms into one framework capable of comparing and selecting different learning methods based on predicted achievable performance.","Title: Dynamic Hill Climbing: Overcoming the limita- tions of optimization techniques  
Abstract: This paper describes a novel search algorithm, called dynamic hill climbing, that borrows ideas from genetic algorithms and hill climbing techniques. Unlike both genetic and hill climbing algorithms, dynamic hill climbing has the ability to dynamically change its coordinate frame during the course of an optimization. Furthermore, the algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate and uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space. Dynamic hill climbing is empirically compared to a traditional genetic algorithm using De Jong's well-known five function test suite [4] and is shown to vastly surpass the performance of the genetic algorithm, often finding better solutions using only 1% as many function evaluations.

"Title: Machine Learning by Function Decomposition  
Abstract: We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a definition of the target concept in terms of a hierarchy of intermediate concepts and their definitions. This effectively decomposes the problem into smaller, less complex problems. The method is inspired by the Boolean function decomposition approach to the design of digital circuits. To cope with high time complexity of finding an optimal decomposition, we propose a suboptimal heuristic algorithm. The method, implemented in program HINT (HIerarchy Induction Tool), is experimentally evaluated using a set of artificial and real-world learning problems. It is shown that the method performs well both in terms of classification accuracy and discovery of meaningful concept hierarchies.","Title: Rapid Quality Estimation of Neural Network Input Representations

"Title: Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights  
Abstract: Supervised neural networks generalize well if there is much less information in the weights than there is in the output vectors of the training cases. So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-off between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed efficiently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights.","Title: A Statistical Approach to Decision Tree Modeling

In this paper, we present an efficient solution to the second problem based on caching the results of the first. Our proposal has been implemented in brainstormer, a planner that takes abstract advice. ","Title: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Theoretical Framework and an Algorithm  
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt general-sum stochastic games as a framework for multiagent reinforcement learning. Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under specified conditions. This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies.",0
"Title: Cryptographic Limitations on Learning Boolean Formulae and Finite Automata  
Abstract: In this paper we prove the intractability of learning several classes of Boolean functions in the distribution-free model (also called the Probably Approximately Correct or PAC model) of learning from examples. These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography. We also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a gener - alization of graph coloring. fl This research was conducted while the author was at Harvard University and supported by an A.T.& T.

","Title: Using the Grow-And-Prune Network to Solve Problems of Large Dimensionality  
Abstract: This paper investigates a technique for creating sparsely connected feed-forward neural networks which may be capable of producing networks that have very large input and output layers. The architecture appears to be particularly suited to tasks that involve sparse training data as it is able to take advantage of the sparseness to further reduce training time. Some initial results are presented based on tests on the 16 bit compression problem. ",0
"Title: New Methods for Competitive Coevolution  
Abstract: We consider ""competitive coevolution,"" in which fitness is based on direct competition among individuals selected from two independently evolving populations of ""hosts"" and ""parasites."" Competitive coevolution can lead to an ""arms race,"" in which the two populations reciprocally drive one another to increasing levels of performance and complexity. We use the games of Nim and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe as test problems to explore three new techniques in competitive coevolution. ""Competitive fitness sharing"" changes the way fitness is measured, ""shared sampling"" provides a method for selecting a strong, diverse set of parasites, and the ""hall of fame"" encourages arms races by saving good individuals from prior generations. We provide several different motivations for these methods, and mathematical insights into their use. Experimental comparisons are done, and a detailed analysis of these experiments is presented in terms of testing issues, diversity, extinction, arms race progress measurements, and drift. ","Title: [12] J. Whittaker. Graphical Models in Applied Mathematical Multivariate Statis-  
Abstract: Self-organizing feature maps are usually implemented by abstracting the low-level neural and parallel distributed processes. An external supervisor finds the unit whose weight vector is closest in Euclidian distance to the input vector and determines the neighborhood for weight adaptation. The weights are changed proportional to the Euclidian distance. In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved. It is also necessary to add a redundant dimension to the input vectors.",0
"Title: Nonlinearity, Hyperplane Ranking and the Simple Genetic Algorithm  
Abstract: Several metrics are used in empirical studies to explore the mechanisms of convergence of genetic algorithms. The metric is designed to measure the consistency of an arbitrary ranking of hyperplanes in a partition with respect to a target string. Walsh coefficients can be calculated for small functions in order to characterize sources of linear and nonlinear interactions. A simple deception measure is also developed to look closely at the effects of increasing nonlinearity of functions. Correlations between the metric and deception measure are discussed and relationships between and convergence behavior of a simple genetic algorithm are studied over large sets of functions with varying degrees of nonlinearity.","Title: Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing by a Multiple Scale Neural System for Boundary and Surface Representation  
Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.",0
"Title: Improving accuracy by combining rule-based and case-based reasoning  
Abstract: An architecture is presented for combining rule-based and case-based reasoning. The architecture is intended for domains that are understood reasonably well, but still imperfectly. It uses a set of rules, which are taken to be only approximately correct, to obtain a preliminary answer for a given problem; it then draws analogies from cases to handle exceptions to the rules. Having rules together with cases not only increases the architecture's domain coverage, it also allows innovative ways of doing case-based reasoning: the same rules that are used for rule-based reasoning are also used by the case-based component to do case indexing and case adaptation. The architecture was applied to the task of name pronunciation, and, with minimal knowledge engineering, was found to perform almost at the level of the best commercial systems. Moreover, its accuracy was found to exceed what it could have achieved with rules or cases alone, thus demonstrating the accuracy improvement afforded by combining rule-based and case-based reasoning.

","Title: Evolving Non-Determinism: An Inventive and Efficient Tool for Optimization and Discovery of Strategies  
Abstract: In the field of optimization and machine learning techniques, some very efficient and promising tools like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Hill-Climbing have been designed. In this same field, the Evolving Non-Determinism (END) model proposes an inventive way to explore the space of states that, combined with the use of simulated co-evolution, remedies some drawbacks of these previous techniques and even allow this model to outperform them on some difficult problems. This new model has been applied to the sorting network problem, a reference problem that challenged many computer scientists, and an original one-player game named Solitaire. For the first problem, the END model has been able to build from scratch some sorting networks as good as the best known for the 16-input problem. It even improved by one comparator a 25 years old result for the 13-input problem! For the Solitaire game, END evolved a strategy comparable to a human designed strategy. ",0

","Title: Adaptive probabilistic networks  
Abstract: Belief networks (or probabilistic networks) and neural networks are two forms of network representations that have been used in the development of intelligent systems in the field of artificial intelligence. Belief networks provide a concise representation of general probability distributions over a set of random variables, and facilitate exact calculation of the impact of evidence on propositions of interest. Neural networks, which represent parameterized algebraic combinations of nonlinear activation functions, have found widespread use as models of real neural systems and as function approximators because of their amenability to simple training algorithms. Furthermore, the simple, local nature of most neural network training algorithms provides a certain biological plausibility and allows for a massively parallel implementation. In this paper, we show that similar local learning algorithms can be derived for belief networks, and that these learning algorithms can operate using only information that is directly available from the normal, inferential processes of the networks. This removes the main obstacle preventing belief networks from competing with neural networks on the above-mentioned tasks. The precise, local, probabilistic interpretation of belief networks also allows them to be partially or wholly constructed by humans; allows the results of learning to be easily understood; and allows them to contribute to rational decision-making in a well-defined way.

"Title: Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Disease Rates  
Abstract: Maps of regional morbidity and mortality rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with socio-demographic census information, they also permit assessment of environmental justice, i.e., whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this paper we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly-parametrized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection. We illustrate our approach using a dataset of county-specific lung cancer rates in the state of Ohio during the period 1968-1988. ","Title: Universal Portfolios With and Without Transaction Costs  
Abstract: A constant rebalanced portfolio is an investment strategy which keeps the same distribution of wealth among a set of stocks from period to period. Recently there has been work on on-line investment strategies that are competitive with the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight (Cover, 1991; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996b; Ordentlich and Cover, 1996; Cover, 1996). For the universal algorithm of Cover (Cover, 1991), we provide a simple analysis which naturally extends to the case of a fixed percentage transaction cost (commission), answering a question raised in (Cover, 1991; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996b; Ordentlich and Cover, 1996; Cover, 1996). In addition, we present a simple randomized implementation that is significantly faster in practice. We conclude by explaining how these algorithms can be applied to other problems, such as combining the predictions of statistical language models, where the resulting guarantees are more striking.

"Title: A Competitive Approach to Game Learning  
Abstract: Machine learning of game strategies has often depended on competitive methods that continually develop new strategies capable of defeating previous ones. We use a very inclusive definition of game and consider a framework within which a competitive algorithm makes repeated use of a strategy learning component that can learn strategies which defeat a given set of opponents. We describe game learning in terms of sets H and X of first and second player strategies, and connect the model with more familiar models of concept learning. We show the importance of the ideas of teaching set [20] and specification number [19] k in this new context. The performance of several competitive algorithms is investigated, using both worst-case and randomized strategy learning algorithms. Our central result (Theorem 4) is a competitive algorithm that solves games in a total number of strategies polynomial in lg(jHj), lg(jX j), and k. Its use is demonstrated, including an application in concept learning with a new kind of counterexample oracle. We conclude with a complexity analysis of game learning, and list a number of new questions arising from this work. ","Title: Advantages of Decision Lists and Implicit Negatives in Inductive Logic Programming  
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the capabilities of Foidl, an inductive logic programming (ILP) system whose distinguishing characteristics are the ability to produce first-order decision lists, the use of an output completeness assumption as a substitute for negative examples, and the use of intensional background knowledge. The development of Foidl was originally motivated by the problem of learning to generate the past tense of English verbs; however, this paper demonstrates its superior performance on two different sets of benchmark ILP problems. Tests on the finite element mesh design problem show that Foidl's decision lists enable it to produce generally more accurate results than a range of methods previously applied to this problem. Tests with a selection of list-processing problems from Bratko's introductory Prolog text demonstrate that the combination of implicit negatives and intensionality allow Foidl to learn correct programs from far fewer examples than Foil.",0

Abstract: It is well known that search-space reformulation can improve the speed and reliability of numerical optimization in engineering design. We argue that the best choice of reformulation depends on the design goal, and present a technique for automatically constructing rules that map the design goal into a reformulation chosen from a space of possible reformulations. We tested our technique in the domain of racing-yacht-hull design, where each reformulation corresponds to incorporating constraints into the search space. We applied a standard inductive-learning algorithm, C4.5, to a set of training data describing which constraints are active in the optimal design for each goal encountered in a previous design session. We then used these rules to choose an appropriate reformulation for each of a set of test cases. Our experimental results show that using these reformulations improves both the speed and the reliability of design optimization, outperforming competing methods and approaching the best performance possible.

"Title: Two is better than one: A diploid genotype for neural networks  
Abstract: In nature the genotype of many organisms exhibits diploidy, i.e., it includes two copies of every gene. In this paper we describe the results of simulations comparing the behavior of haploid and diploid populations of ecological neural networks living in both fixed and changing environments. We show that diploid genotypes create more variability in fitness in the population than haploid genotypes and buffer better environmental change; as a consequence, if one wants to obtain good results for both average and peak fitness in a single population one should choose a diploid population with an appropriate mutation rate. Some results of our simulations parallel biological findings.","Title: Lazy Acquisition of Place Knowledge  
Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. Our framework represents distinct places as evidence grids, a probabilistic description of occupancy. Place recognition relies on nearest neighbor classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translational differences between the two grids. The learning mechanism is lazy in that it involves the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. Experimental studies with physical and simulated robots suggest that this approach improves place recognition with experience, that it can handle significant sensor noise, that it benefits from improved quality in stored cases, and that it scales well to environments with many distinct places. Additional studies suggest that using historical information about the robot's path through the environment can actually reduce recognition accuracy. Previous researchers have studied evidence grids and place learning, but they have not combined these two powerful concepts, nor have they used systematic experimentation to evaluate their methods' abilities.

"Title: d d MISC: A Multiple Instruction Stream Computer  
Abstract: This paper describes a single chip Multiple Instruction Stream Computer (MISC) capable of extracting instruction level parallelism from a broad spectrum of programs. The MISC architecture uses multiple asynchronous processing elements to separate a program into streams that can be executed in parallel, and integrates a conflict-free message passing system into the lowest level of the processor design to facilitate low latency intra-MISC communication. This approach allows for increased machine parallelism with minimal code expansion, and provides an alternative approach to single instruction stream multi-issue machines such as SuperScalar and VLIW. ","Title: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR COORDINATED REACTIVE CONTROL  
Abstract: The demands of rapid response and the complexity of many environments make it difficult to decompose, tune and coordinate reactive behaviors while ensuring consistency. Reinforcement learning networks can address the tuning problem, but do not address the problem of decomposition and coordination. We hypothesize that interacting reactions can often be decomposed into separate control tasks resident in separate networks and that the interaction can be coordinated through the tuning mechanism and a higher level controller. To explore these issues, we have implemented a reinforcement learning architecture as the reactive component of a two layer control system for a simulated race car. By varying the architecture, we test whether decomposing reactivity into separate controllers leads to superior overall performance and learning convergence in our domain. ",0
"Title: Online Learning with Random Representations  
Abstract: We consider the requirements of online learning|learning which must be done incrementally and in realtime, with the results of learning available soon after each new example is acquired. Despite the abundance of methods for learning from examples, there are few that can be used effectively for online learning, e.g., as components of reinforcement learning systems. Most of these few, including radial basis functions, CMACs, Ko-honen's self-organizing maps, and those developed in this paper, share the same structure. All expand the original input representation into a higher dimensional representation in an unsupervised way, and then map that representation to the final answer using a relatively simple supervised learner, such as a perceptron or LMS rule. Such structures learn very rapidly and reliably, but have been thought either to scale poorly or to require extensive domain knowledge. To the contrary, some researchers (Rosenblatt, 1962; Gallant & Smith, 1987; Kanerva, 1988; Prager & Fallside, 1988) have argued that the expanded representation can be chosen largely at random with good results. The main contribution of this paper is to develop and test this hypothesis. We show that simple random-representation methods can perform as well as nearest-neighbor methods (while being more suited to online learning), and significantly better than backpropagation. We find that the size of the random representation does increase with the dimensionality of the problem, but not unreasonably so, and that the required size can be reduced substantially using unsupervised-learning techniques. Our results suggest that randomness has a useful role to play in online supervised learning and constructive induction. ","Title: Estimating Bayes Factors via Posterior Simulation with the Laplace-Metropolis Estimator  
Abstract: The key quantity needed for Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection is the marginal likelihood for a model, also known as the integrated likelihood, or the marginal probability of the data. In this paper we describe a way to use posterior simulation output to estimate marginal likelihoods. We describe the basic Laplace-Metropolis estimator for models without random effects. For models with random effects the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator is introduced. This estimator is applied to data from the World Fertility Survey and shown to give accurate results. Batching of simulation output is used to assess the uncertainty involved in using the compound Laplace-Metropolis estimator. The method allows us to test for the effects of independent variables in a random effects model, and also to test for the presence of the random effects.",0
"Title: Solving the Temporal Binding Problem: A Neural Theory for Constructing and Updating Object Files  
Abstract: Visual objects are perceived only if their parts are correctly identified and integrated. A neural network theory is proposed that seeks to explain how the human visual system binds together visual properties, dispersed over space and time, of multiple objects a problem known as the temporal binding problem [49, 30]. The proposed theory is based upon neural mechanisms that construct and update object representations through the interactions of a serial attentional mechanism for location and object-based selection, preattentive Gestalt-based grouping mechanisms, and an associative memory structure that binds together object identity, form, and spatial information. A working model is presented that provides a unified quantitative explanation of results from psychophysical experiments on object review, object integration and multielement tracking.
