"Title: Language acquisition: do children and language models follow similar learning stages?
Abstract: During language acquisition, children follow a typical sequence of learning stages, whereby they first learn to categorize phonemes before they develop their lexicon and eventually master increasingly complex syntactic structures. However, the computational principles that lead to this learning trajectory remain largely unknown. To investigate this, we here compare the learning trajectories of deep language models to those of children. Specifically, we test whether, during its training, GPT-2 exhibits stages of language acquisition comparable to those observed in children aged between 18 months and 6 years. For this, we train 48 GPT-2 models from scratch and evaluate their syntactic and semantic abilities at each training step, using 96 probes curated from the BLiMP, Zorro and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We then compare these evaluations with the behavior of 54 children during language production. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, similarly to children, the language models tend to learn linguistic skills in a systematic order. Second, this learning scheme is parallel: the language tasks that are learned last improve from the very first training steps. Third, some - but not all - learning stages are shared between children and these language models. Overall, these results shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlight important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process natural language.","Title: Information-Restricted Neural Language Models Reveal Different Brain Regions' Sensitivity to Semantics, Syntax and Context
Abstract: A fundamental question in neurolinguistics concerns the brain regions involved in syntactic and semantic processing during speech comprehension, both at the lexical (word processing) and supra-lexical levels (sentence and discourse processing). To what extent are these regions separated or intertwined? To address this question, we trained a lexical language model, Glove, and a supra-lexical language model, GPT-2, on a text corpus from which we selectively removed either syntactic or semantic information. We then assessed to what extent these information-restricted models were able to predict the time-courses of fMRI signal of humans listening to naturalistic text. We also manipulated the size of contextual information provided to GPT-2 in order to determine the windows of integration of brain regions involved in supra-lexical processing. Our analyses show that, while most brain regions involved in language are sensitive to both syntactic and semantic variables, the relative magnitudes of these effects vary a lot across these regions. Furthermore, we found an asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres, with semantic and syntactic processing being more dissociated in the left hemisphere than in the right, and the left and right hemispheres showing respectively greater sensitivity to short and long contexts. The use of information-restricted NLP models thus shed new light on the spatial organization of syntactic processing, semantic processing and compositionality."
"Title: Do We Still Need Clinical Language Models?
Abstract: Although recent advances in scaling large language models (LLMs) have resulted in improvements on many NLP tasks, it remains unclear whether these models trained primarily with general web text are the right tool in highly specialized, safety critical domains such as clinical text. Recent results have suggested that LLMs encode a surprising amount of medical knowledge. This raises an important question regarding the utility of smaller domain-specific language models. With the success of general-domain LLMs, is there still a need for specialized clinical models? To investigate this question, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of 12 language models, ranging from 220M to 175B parameters, measuring their performance on 3 different clinical tasks that test their ability to parse and reason over electronic health records. As part of our experiments, we train T5-Base and T5-Large models from scratch on clinical notes from MIMIC III and IV to directly investigate the efficiency of clinical tokens. We show that relatively small specialized clinical models substantially outperform all in-context learning approaches, even when finetuned on limited annotated data. Further, we find that pretraining on clinical tokens allows for smaller, more parameter-efficient models that either match or outperform much larger language models trained on general text. We release the code and the models used under the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data license and data use agreement.","Title: Towards More Robust NLP System Evaluation: Handling Missing Scores in Benchmarks
Abstract: The evaluation of natural language processing (NLP) systems is crucial for advancing the field, but current benchmarking approaches often assume that all systems have scores available for all tasks, which is not always practical. In reality, several factors such as the cost of running baseline, private systems, computational limitations, or incomplete data may prevent some systems from being evaluated on entire tasks. This paper formalize an existing problem in NLP research: benchmarking when some systems scores are missing on the task, and proposes a novel approach to address it. Our method utilizes a compatible partial ranking approach to impute missing data, which is then aggregated using the Borda count method. It includes two refinements designed specifically for scenarios where either task-level or instance-level scores are available. We also introduce an extended benchmark, which contains over 131 million scores, an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. We validate our methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in addressing the challenge of missing system evaluation on an entire task. This work highlights the need for more comprehensive benchmarking approaches that can handle real-world scenarios where not all systems are evaluated on the entire task."
"Title: CHiLS: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets
Abstract: Open vocabulary models (e.g. CLIP) have shown strong performance on zero-shot classification through their ability generate embeddings for each class based on their (natural language) names. Prior work has focused on improving the accuracy of these models through prompt engineering or by incorporating a small amount of labeled downstream data (via finetuning). However, there has been little focus on improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and are uninformative. We propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information. CHiLS is simple to implement within existing zero-shot pipelines and requires no additional training cost.

Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP and ALIGN) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in acquiring transferable visual representations. To leverage the valuable knowledge encoded within these models for downstream tasks, several fine-tuning approaches, including prompt tuning methods and adapter-based methods, have been developed to adapt vision-language models effectively with supervision. However, these methods rely on the availability of annotated samples, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming to acquire, thus limiting scalability. To address this issue, in this work, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning approach for vision-language models called Unsupervised Prototype Adapter (UP-Adapter). Specifically, for the unannotated target datasets, we leverage the text-image aligning capability of CLIP to automatically select the most confident samples for each class. Utilizing these selected samples, we generate class prototypes, which serve as the initialization for the learnable prototype model. After fine-tuning, the prototype model prediction is combined with the original CLIP's prediction by a residual connection to perform downstream recognition tasks. Our extensive experimental results on image recognition and domain generalization show that the proposed unsupervised method outperforms 8-shot CoOp, 8-shot Tip-Adapter, and also the state-of-the-art UPL method by large margins."
"Title: Neuralangelo: High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction
Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction has been shown to be powerful for recovering dense 3D surfaces via image-based neural rendering. However, current methods struggle to recover detailed structures of real-world scenes. To address the issue, we present Neuralangelo, which combines the representation power of multiresolution 3D hash grids with neural surface rendering. Two key ingredients enable our approach: (1) numerical gradients for computing higher-order derivatives as a smoothing operation and (2) coarse-to-fine optimization on the hash grids controlling different levels of details. Even without auxiliary inputs such as depth, Neuralangelo can effectively recover dense 3D surface structures from multiview images with fidelity significantly surpassing previous methods, enabling detailed large-scale scene reconstruction from RGB video captures.","Title: DiVA-360: The Dynamic Visuo-Audio Dataset for Immersive Neural Fields
Abstract: Advances in neural fields are enabling high-fidelity capture of the shape and appearance of static and dynamic scenes. However, their capabilities lag behind those offered by representations such as pixels or meshes due to algorithmic challenges and the lack of large-scale real-world datasets. We address the dataset limitation with DiVA-360, a real-world 360 dynamic visual-audio dataset with synchronized multimodal visual, audio, and textual information about table-scale scenes. It contains 46 dynamic scenes, 30 static scenes, and 95 static objects spanning 11 categories captured using a new hardware system using 53 RGB cameras at 120 FPS and 6 microphones for a total of 8.6M image frames and 1360 s of dynamic data. We provide detailed text descriptions for all scenes, foreground-background segmentation masks, category-specific 3D pose alignment for static objects, as well as metrics for comparison. Our data, hardware and software, and code are available at https://diva360.github.io/."

Abstract: This work presents a new multimodal system for remote attention level estimation based on multimodal face analysis. Our multimodal approach uses different parameters and signals obtained from the behavior and physiological processes that have been related to modeling cognitive load such as faces gestures (e.g., blink rate, facial actions units) and user actions (e.g., head pose, distance to the camera). The multimodal system uses the following modules based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Eye blink detection, head pose estimation, facial landmark detection, and facial expression features. First, we individually evaluate the proposed modules in the task of estimating the student's attention level captured during online e-learning sessions. For that we trained binary classifiers (high or low attention) based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) for each module. Secondly, we find out to what extent multimodal score level fusion improves the attention level estimation. The mEBAL database is used in the experimental framework, a public multi-modal database for attention level estimation obtained in an e-learning environment that contains data from 38 users while conducting several e-learning tasks of variable difficulty (creating changes in student cognitive loads)."
"Title: Continual Evidential Deep Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection
Abstract: Uncertainty-based deep learning models have attracted a great deal of interest for their ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions. Evidential deep learning stands out achieving remarkable performance in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data with a single deterministic neural network. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose the integration of an evidential deep learning method into a continual learning framework in order to perform simultaneously incremental object classification and OOD detection. Moreover, we analyze the ability of vacuity and dissonance to differentiate between in-distribution data belonging to old classes and OOD data. The proposed method, called CEDL, is evaluated on CIFAR-100 considering two settings consisting of 5 and 10 tasks, respectively. From the obtained results, we could appreciate that the proposed method, in addition to provide comparable results in object classification with respect to the baseline, largely outperforms OOD detection compared to several posthoc methods on three evaluation metrics: AUROC, AUPR and FPR95.","Title: What Can Human Sketches Do for Object Detection?
Abstract: Sketches are highly expressive, inherently capturing subjective and fine-grained visual cues. The exploration of such innate properties of human sketches has, however, been limited to that of image retrieval. In this paper, for the first time, we cultivate the expressiveness of sketches but for the fundamental vision task of object detection. The end result is a sketch-enabled object detection framework that detects based on what you sketch – that “zebra” (e.g., one that is eating the grass) in a herd of zebras (instance-aware detection), and only the part (e.g., “head” of a “zebra”) that you desire (part-aware detection). We further dictate that our model works without (i) knowing which category to expect at testing (zero-shot) and (ii) not requiring additional bounding boxes (as per fully supervised) and class labels (as per weakly supervised). Instead of devising a model from the ground up, we show an intuitive synergy between foundation models (e.g., CLIP) and existing sketch models build for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), which can already elegantly solve the task – CLIP to provide model generalisation, and SBIR to bridge the (sketch→photo) gap. In particular, we first perform independent prompting on both sketch and photo branches of an SBIR model to build highly generalisable sketch and photo encoders on the back of the generalisation ability of CLIP. We then devise a training paradigm to adapt the learned encoders for object detection, such that the region embeddings of detected boxes are aligned with the sketch and photo embeddings from SBIR. Evaluating our framework on standard object detection datasets like PASCAL-VOC and MS-COCO outperforms both supervised (SOD) and weakly-supervised object detectors (WSOD) on zero-shot setups.

"Title: The Costly Dilemma: Generalization, Evaluation and Cost-Optimal Deployment of Large Language Models
Abstract: When deploying machine learning models in production for any product/application, there are three properties that are commonly desired. First, the models should be generalizable, in that we can extend it to further use cases as our knowledge of the domain area develops. Second they should be evaluable, so that there are clear metrics for performance and the calculation of those metrics in production settings are feasible. Finally, the deployment should be cost-optimal as far as possible. In this paper we propose that these three objectives (i.e. generalization, evaluation and cost-optimality) can often be relatively orthogonal and that for large language models, despite their performance over conventional NLP models, enterprises need to carefully assess all the three factors before making substantial investments in this technology. We propose a framework for generalization, evaluation and cost-modeling specifically tailored to large language models, offering insights into the intricacies of development, deployment and management for these large language models.","Title: Multi-Agent Collaboration: Harnessing the Power of Intelligent LLM Agents
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the power of multi-agent systems. Our framework introduces a collaborative environment where multiple intelligent agent components, each with distinctive attributes and roles, work together to handle complex tasks more efficiently and effectively. We demonstrate the practicality and versatility of our framework through case studies in artificial general intelligence (AGI), specifically focusing on the Auto-GPT and BabyAGI models. We also examine the""Gorilla""model, which integrates external APIs into the LLM. Our framework addresses limitations and challenges such as looping issues, security risks, scalability, system evaluation, and ethical considerations. By modeling various domains such as courtroom simulations and software development scenarios, we showcase the potential applications and benefits of our proposed multi-agent system. Our framework provides an avenue for advancing the capabilities and performance of LLMs through collaboration and knowledge exchange among intelligent agents."
"Title: Cerebras-GPT: Open Compute-Optimal Language Models Trained on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster
Abstract: We study recent research advances that improve large language models through efficient pre-training and scaling, and open datasets and tools. We combine these advances to introduce Cerebras-GPT, a family of open compute-optimal language models scaled from 111M to 13B parameters. We train Cerebras-GPT models on the Eleuther Pile dataset following DeepMind Chinchilla scaling rules for efficient pre-training (highest accuracy for a given compute budget). We characterize the predictable power-law scaling and compare Cerebras-GPT with other publicly-available models to show all Cerebras-GPT models have state-of-the-art training efficiency on both pre-training and downstream objectives. We describe our learnings including how Maximal Update Parameterization ($\mu$P) can further improve large model scaling, improving accuracy and hyperparameter predictability at scale. We release our pre-trained models and code, making this paper the first open and reproducible work comparing compute-optimal model scaling to models trained on fixed dataset sizes.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) system inspired by the philosophical and psychoanalytical concept of imagination as a ``Re-construction of Experiences"". Our AI system is equipped with an imagination-inspired module that bridges the gap between textual inputs and other modalities, enriching the derived information based on previously learned experiences. A unique feature of our system is its ability to formulate independent perceptions of inputs. This leads to unique interpretations of a concept that may differ from human interpretations but are equally valid, a phenomenon we term as ``Interpretable Misunderstanding"". We employ large-scale models, specifically a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), enabling our proposed system to extract meaningful information across modalities while primarily remaining unimodal. We evaluated our system against other large language models across multiple tasks, including emotion recognition and question-answering, using a zero-shot methodology to ensure an unbiased scenario that may happen by fine-tuning. Significantly, our system outperformed the best Large Language Models (LLM) on the MELD, IEMOCAP, and CoQA datasets, achieving Weighted F1 (WF1) scores of 46.74%, 25.23%, and Overall F1 (OF1) score of 17%, respectively, compared to 22.89%, 12.28%, and 7% from the well-performing LLM. The goal is to go beyond the statistical view of language processing and tie it to human concepts such as philosophy and psychoanalysis. This work represents a significant advancement in the development of imagination-inspired AI systems, opening new possibilities for AI to generate deep and interpretable information across modalities, thereby enhancing human-AI interaction."
"Title: Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts
Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.","Title: Learning Customized Visual Models with Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge
Abstract: Image-text contrastive learning models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong task transfer ability. The high generality and usability of these visual models is achieved via a web-scale data collection process to ensure broad concept coverage, followed by expensive pre-training to feed all the knowledge into model weights. Alternatively, we propose React,REtrieval-Augmented CusTomization, a framework to acquire the relevant web knowledge to build customized visual models for target domains. We retrieve the most relevant image-text pairs $(\thicksim3\%$ of CLIP pre-training data) from the web-scale database as external knowledge and propose to customize the model by only training new modularized blocks while freezing all the original weights. The effectiveness of Reactis demonstrated via extensive experiments on classification, retrieval, detection and segmentation tasks, including zero, few, and full-shot settings. Particularly, on the zero-shot classification task, compared with CLIP, it achieves up to 5.4% improvement on ImageNet and 3.7% on the Elevaterbenchmark (20 datasets)."
"Title: NS3D: Neuro-Symbolic Grounding of 3D Objects and Relations
Abstract: Grounding object properties and relations in 3D scenes is a prerequisite for a wide range of artificial intelligence tasks, such as visually grounded dialogues and embodied manipulation. However, the variability of the 3D domain induces two fundamental challenges: 1) the expense of labeling and 2) the complexity of 3D grounded language. Hence, essential desiderata for models are to be data-efficient, generalize to different data distributions and tasks with unseen semantic forms, as well as ground complex language semantics (e.g., view-point anchoring and multi-object reference). To address these challenges, we propose NS3D, a neuro-symbolic framework for 3D grounding. NS3D translates language into programs with hierarchical structures by leveraging large language-to-code models. Different functional modules in the programs are implemented as neural networks. Notably, NS3D extends prior neuro-symbolic visual reasoning methods by introducing functional modules that effectively reason about high-arity relations (i.e., relations among more than two objects), key in disambiguating objects in complex 3D scenes. Modular and compositional architecture enables NS3D to achieve state-of-the-art results on the ReferIt3D view-dependence task, a 3D referring expression compre-hension benchmark. Importantly, NS3D shows significantly improved performance on settings of data-efficiency and generalization, and demonstrate zero-shot transfer to an unseen 3D question-answering task.","Title: Motion Question Answering via Modular Motion Programs
Abstract: In order to build artificial intelligence systems that can perceive and reason with human behavior in the real world, we must first design models that conduct complex spatio-temporal reasoning over motion sequences. Moving towards this goal, we propose the HumanMotionQA task to evaluate complex, multi-step reasoning abilities of models on long-form human motion sequences. We generate a dataset of question-answer pairs that require detecting motor cues in small portions of motion sequences, reasoning temporally about when events occur, and querying specific motion attributes. In addition, we propose NSPose, a neuro-symbolic method for this task that uses symbolic reasoning and a modular design to ground motion through learning motion concepts, attribute neural operators, and temporal relations. We demonstrate the suitability of NSPose for the HumanMotionQA task, outperforming all baseline methods."
"Title: Are Machine Rationales (Not) Useful to Humans? Measuring and Improving Human Utility of Free-text Rationales
Abstract: Among the remarkable emergent capabilities of large language models (LMs) is free-text rationalization; beyond certain scale, large LMs are capable of generating seemingly useful rationalizations, which in turn, can dramatically enhance their performances on leaderboards. This phenomenon raises a question: can machine generated rationales also be useful for humans, especially when lay humans try to answer questions based on those machine rationales? We observe that human utility of existing rationales is far from satisfactory and expensive to estimate with human studies. Existing metrics like task performance of the LM generating the rationales or similarity between generated and gold rationales are not good indicators of their human utility. While we observe that certain properties of rationales like conciseness and novelty are correlated with their human utility, estimating them without human involvement is challenging. We show that, by estimating a rationale’s helpfulness in answering similar unseen instances, we can measure its human utility to a better extent. We also translate this finding into an automated score, Gen-U, that we propose, which can help improve LMs’ ability to generate rationales with better human utility, while maintaining most of its task performance. Lastly, we release all code and collected data with this project.","Title: Can Language Models Teach Weaker Agents? Teacher Explanations Improve Students via Theory of Mind
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning by generating explanations for their predictions. However, a complementary goal of explanations is to also communicate useful knowledge that improves weaker agents. Hence, we investigate whether LLMs also make good teachers for weaker agents. In particular, we consider a student-teacher framework between two LLM agents and study if, when, and how the teacher should intervene with natural language explanations to improve the student's performance. Since communication is expensive, we define a budget such that the teacher only communicates explanations for a fraction of the data, after which the student should perform well on its own. We decompose the teaching problem along four axes: (1) if teacher's test time intervention improve student predictions, (2) when it is worth explaining a data point, (3) how the teacher should personalize explanations to better teach the student, and (4) if teacher explanations also improve student performance on future unexplained data. We first show that teacher LLMs can indeed intervene on student reasoning to improve their performance. Next, we propose a Theory of Mind approach, in which the teacher builds two few-shot mental models of the student. The first model defines an Intervention Function that simulates the utility of an intervention, allowing the teacher to intervene when this utility is the highest and improving student performance at lower budgets. The second model enables the teacher to personalize explanations for a particular student and outperform unpersonalized teachers. We also demonstrate that in multi-turn interactions, teacher explanations generalize and learning from explained data improves student performance on future unexplained data. Finally, we also verify that misaligned teachers can lower student performance to random chance by intentionally misleading them."
"Title: STEPS: Joint Self-supervised Nighttime Image Enhancement and Depth Estimation
Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation draws a lot of attention recently as it can promote the 3D sensing capa-bilities of self-driving vehicles. However, it intrinsically relies upon the photometric consistency assumption, which hardly holds during nighttime. Although various supervised night-time image enhancement methods have been proposed, their generalization performance in challenging driving scenarios is not satisfactory. To this end, we propose the first method that jointly learns a nighttime image enhancer and a depth estimator, without using ground truth for either task. Our method tightly entangles two self-supervised tasks using a newly proposed uncertain pixel masking strategy. This strategy originates from the observation that nighttime images not only suffer from underexposed regions but also from overexposed regions. By fitting a bridge-shaped curve to the illumination map distribution, both regions are suppressed and two tasks are bridged naturally. We benchmark the method on two established datasets: nuScenes and RobotCar and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both of them. Detailed ablations also reveal the mechanism of our proposal. Last but not least, to mitigate the problem of sparse ground truth of existing datasets, we provide a new photo-realistically enhanced nighttime dataset based upon CARLA. It brings meaningful new challenges to the community. Codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/ucaszyp/STEPS.","Title: MARS: An Instance-aware, Modular and Realistic Simulator for Autonomous Driving
Abstract: Nowadays, autonomous cars can drive smoothly in ordinary cases, and it is widely recognized that realistic sensor simulation will play a critical role in solving remaining corner cases by simulating them. To this end, we propose an autonomous driving simulator based upon neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Compared with existing works, ours has three notable features: (1) Instance-aware. Our simulator models the foreground instances and background environments separately with independent networks so that the static (e.g., size and appearance) and dynamic (e.g., trajectory) properties of instances can be controlled separately. (2) Modular. Our simulator allows flexible switching between different modern NeRF-related backbones, sampling strategies, input modalities, etc. We expect this modular design to boost academic progress and industrial deployment of NeRF-based autonomous driving simulation. (3) Realistic. Our simulator set new state-of-the-art photo-realism results given the best module selection. Our simulator will be open-sourced while most of our counterparts are not.

"Title: MetaGait: Learning to Learn an Omni Sample Adaptive Representation for Gait Recognition
Abstract: nan","Title: Condition-Adaptive Graph Convolution Learning for Skeleton-Based Gait Recognition
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have been widely applied in skeleton-based gait recognition. A key challenge in this task is to distinguish the individual walking styles of different subjects across various views. Existing state-of-the-art methods employ uniform convolutions to extract features from diverse sequences and ignore the effects of viewpoint changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a condition-adaptive graph (CAG) convolution network that can dynamically adapt to the specific attributes of each skeleton sequence and the corresponding view angle. In contrast to using fixed weights for all joints and sequences, we introduce a joint-specific filter learning (JSFL) module in the CAG method, which produces sequence-adaptive filters at the joint level. The adaptive filters capture fine-grained patterns that are unique to each joint, enabling the extraction of diverse spatial-temporal information about body parts. Additionally, we design a view-adaptive topology learning (VATL) module that generates adaptive graph topologies. These graph topologies are used to correlate the joints adaptively according to the specific view conditions. Thus, CAG can simultaneously adjust to various walking styles and viewpoints. Experiments on the two most widely used datasets (i.e., CASIA-B and OU-MVLP) show that CAG surpasses all previous skeleton-based methods. Moreover, the recognition performance can be enhanced by simply combining CAG with appearance-based methods, demonstrating the ability of CAG to provide useful complementary information."
"Title: Energy Transformer
Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto models of choice in machine learning, typically leading to impressive performance on many applications. At the same time, the architectural development in the transformer world is mostly driven by empirical findings, and the theoretical understanding of their architectural building blocks is rather limited. In contrast, Dense Associative Memory models or Modern Hopfield Networks have a well-established theoretical foundation, but have not yet demonstrated truly impressive practical results. We propose a transformer architecture that replaces the sequence of feedforward transformer blocks with a single large Associative Memory model. Our novel architecture, called Energy Transformer (or ET for short), has many of the familiar architectural primitives that are often used in the current generation of transformers. However, it is not identical to the existing architectures. The sequence of transformer layers in ET is purposely designed to minimize a specifically engineered energy function, which is responsible for representing the relationships between the tokens. As a consequence of this computational principle, the attention in ET is different from the conventional attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce the theoretical foundations of ET, explore it's empirical capabilities using the image completion task, and obtain strong quantitative results on the graph anomaly detection task.","Title: Energy-Based Cross Attention for Bayesian Context Update in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models in image generation tasks, recent studies have raised the issue that generated images sometimes cannot capture the intended semantic contents of the text prompts, which phenomenon is often called semantic misalignment. To address this, here we present a novel energy-based model (EBM) framework. Specifically, we first formulate EBMs of latent image representations and text embeddings in each cross-attention layer of the denoising autoencoder. Then, we obtain the gradient of the log posterior of context vectors, which can be updated and transferred to the subsequent cross-attention layer, thereby implicitly minimizing a nested hierarchy of energy functions. Our latent EBMs further allow zero-shot compositional generation as a linear combination of cross-attention outputs from different contexts. Using extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective in handling various image generation tasks, including multi-concept generation, text-guided image inpainting, and real and synthetic image editing."
"Title: Beyond Appearance: A Semantic Controllable Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Human-Centric Visual Tasks
Abstract: Human-centric visual tasks have attracted increasing research attention due to their widespread applications. In this paper, we aim to learn a general human representation from massive unlabeled human images which can benefit downstream human-centric tasks to the maximum extent. We call this method SOLIDER, a Semantic cOntrollable seLf-supervIseD lEaRning framework. Unlike the existing self-supervised learning methods, prior knowledge from human images is utilized in SOLIDER to build pseudo semantic labels and import more semantic information into the learned representation. Meanwhile, we note that different downstream tasks always require different ratios of semantic information and appearance information. For example, human parsing requires more semantic information, while person re-identification needs more appearance information for identification purpose. So a single learned representation cannot fit for all requirements. To solve this problem, SOLIDER introduces a conditional network with a semantic controller. After the model is trained, users can send values to the controller to produce representations with different ratios of semantic information, which can fit different needs of downstream tasks. Finally, SOLIDER is verified on six downstream human-centric visual tasks. It outperforms state of the arts and builds new baselines for these tasks. The code is released in https://github.com/tinyvision/SOLIDER.","Title: A Gated Attention Transformer for Multi-Person Pose Tracking
Abstract: Multi-person pose tracking is an important element for many applications and requires to estimate the human poses of all persons in a video and to track them over time. The association of poses across frames remains an open research problem, in particular for online tracking methods, due to motion blur, crowded scenes and occlusions. To tackle the association challenge, we propose a Gated Attention Transformer. The core aspect of our model is the gating mechanism that automatically adapts the impact of appearance embeddings and embeddings based on temporal pose similarity in the attention layers. In order to re-identify persons that have been occluded, we incorporate a pose-conditioned re-identification network that provides initial embeddings and allows to match persons even if the number of visible joints differ between frames. We further propose a matching layer based on gated attention for pose-to-track association and duplicate removal. We evaluate our approach on PoseTrack 2018 and PoseTrack21."
"Title: Physically Grounded Vision-Language Models for Robotic Manipulation
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to improved performance on tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Consequently, these models are now well-positioned to reason about the physical world, particularly within domains such as robotic manipulation. However, current VLMs are limited in their understanding of the physical concepts (e.g., material, fragility) of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reasoning about such objects. To address this limitation, we propose PhysObjects, an object-centric dataset of 39.6K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of common household objects. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects improves its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. We incorporate this physically-grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically-grounded VLMs. We additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically-grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improves task success rates. We release our dataset and provide further details and visualizations of our results at https://iliad.stanford.edu/pg-vlm/.","Title: Prompting Large Language Models with Answer Heuristics for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering
Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires external knowledge beyond the image to answer the question. Early studies retrieve required knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces irrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of their models. Recent works have sought to use a large language model (i.e., GPT-3 [3]) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for answering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue that they have not fully activated the capacity of GPT-3 as the provided input information is insufficient. In this paper, we present Prophet-a conceptually simple framework designed to $prompt$ GPT-3 with answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a specific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we extract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. Finally, the two types of answer heuristics are encoded into the prompts to enable GPT-3 to better comprehend the task thus enhancing its capacity. Prophet significantly outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets, OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, delivering 61.1% and 55.7% accuracies on their testing sets, respectively."
"Title: Language-Guided Traffic Simulation via Scene-Level Diffusion
Abstract: Realistic and controllable traffic simulation is a core capability that is necessary to accelerate autonomous vehicle (AV) development. However, current approaches for controlling learning-based traffic models require significant domain expertise and are difficult for practitioners to use. To remedy this, we present CTG++, a scene-level conditional diffusion model that can be guided by language instructions. Developing this requires tackling two challenges: the need for a realistic and controllable traffic model backbone, and an effective method to interface with a traffic model using language. To address these challenges, we first propose a scene-level diffusion model equipped with a spatio-temporal transformer backbone, which generates realistic and controllable traffic. We then harness a large language model (LLM) to convert a user's query into a loss function, guiding the diffusion model towards query-compliant generation. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating realistic, query-compliant traffic simulations.","Title: Text2Motion: From Natural Language Instructions to Feasible Plans
Abstract: We propose Text2Motion, a language-based planning framework enabling robots to solve sequential manipulation tasks that require long-horizon reasoning. Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%. Text2Motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills."
"Title: Easy attention: A simple self-attention mechanism for Transformers
Abstract: To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes usage of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great potential for applications in more complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.","Title: FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning
Abstract: Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\% model FLOPs utilization)."
"Title: Dynamic Mobile-Former: Strengthening Dynamic Convolution with Attention and Residual Connection in Kernel Space
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Mobile-Former(DMF), maximizes the capabilities of dynamic convolution by harmonizing it with efficient operators.Our Dynamic MobileFormer effectively utilizes the advantages of Dynamic MobileNet (MobileNet equipped with dynamic convolution) using global information from light-weight attention.A Transformer in Dynamic Mobile-Former only requires a few randomly initialized tokens to calculate global features, making it computationally efficient.And a bridge between Dynamic MobileNet and Transformer allows for bidirectional integration of local and global features.We also simplify the optimization process of vanilla dynamic convolution by splitting the convolution kernel into an input-agnostic kernel and an input-dependent kernel.This allows for optimization in a wider kernel space, resulting in enhanced capacity.By integrating lightweight attention and enhanced dynamic convolution, our Dynamic Mobile-Former achieves not only high efficiency, but also strong performance.We benchmark the Dynamic Mobile-Former on a series of vision tasks, and showcase that it achieves impressive performance on image classification, COCO detection, and instanace segmentation.For example, our DMF hits the top-1 accuracy of 79.4% on ImageNet-1K, much higher than PVT-Tiny by 4.3% with only 1/4 FLOPs.Additionally,our proposed DMF-S model performed well on challenging vision datasets such as COCO, achieving a 39.0% mAP,which is 1% higher than that of the Mobile-Former 508M model, despite using 3 GFLOPs less computations.Code and models are available at https://github.com/ysj9909/DMF","Title: Run, Don't Walk: Chasing Higher FLOPS for Faster Neural Networks
Abstract: To design fast neural networks, many works have been focusing on reducing the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in FLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of re-duction in latency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and demonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the operators, especially the depthwise con-volution. We hence propose a novel partial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by cutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building upon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks, which attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of devices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-lk, our tiny FasterNet-TO is 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate. Our large FasterNet-L achieves impressive 83.5% top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B, while having 36% higher inference throughput on GPU, as well as saving 37% compute time on CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/JierunChen/FasterNet."
"Title: Comparing Software Developers with ChatGPT: An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: The advent of automation in particular Software Engineering (SE) tasks has transitioned from theory to reality. Numerous scholarly articles have documented the successful application of Artificial Intelligence to address issues in areas such as project management, modeling, testing, and development. A recent innovation is the introduction of ChatGPT, an ML-infused chatbot, touted as a resource proficient in generating programming codes and formulating software testing strategies for developers and testers respectively. Although there is speculation that AI-based computation can increase productivity and even substitute software engineers in software development, there is currently a lack of empirical evidence to verify this. Moreover, despite the primary focus on enhancing the accuracy of AI systems, non-functional requirements including energy efficiency, vulnerability, fairness (i.e., human bias), and safety frequently receive insufficient attention. This paper posits that a comprehensive comparison of software engineers and AI-based solutions, considering various evaluation criteria, is pivotal in fostering human-machine collaboration, enhancing the reliability of AI-based methods, and understanding task suitability for humans or AI. Furthermore, it facilitates the effective implementation of cooperative work structures and human-in-the-loop processes. This paper conducts an empirical investigation, contrasting the performance of software engineers and AI systems, like ChatGPT, across different evaluation metrics. The empirical study includes a case of assessing ChatGPT-generated code versus code produced by developers and uploaded in Leetcode.","Title: Designing explainable artificial intelligence with active inference: A framework for transparent introspection and decision-making
Abstract: This paper investigates the prospect of developing human-interpretable, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on active inference and the free energy principle. We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities."
"Title: Knowledge-aware Bayesian Co-attention for Multimodal Emotion Recognition
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is a challenging research area that aims to fuse different modalities to predict human emotion. However, most existing models that are based on attention mechanisms have difficulty in learning emotionally relevant parts on their own. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate external emotion-related knowledge in the co-attention based fusion of pre-trained models. To effectively incorporate this knowledge, we enhance the co-attention model with a Bayesian attention module (BAM) where a prior distribution is estimated using the emotion-related knowledge. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that the proposed approach can outperform several state-of-the-art approaches by at least 0.7% unweighted accuracy (UA).","Title: GEmo-CLAP: Gender-Attribute-Enhanced Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining for Accurate Speech Emotion Recognition
Abstract: Contrastive cross-modality pretraining has recently exhibited impressive success in diverse fields, whereas there is limited research on their merits in speech emotion recognition (SER). In this paper, we propose GEmo-CLAP, a kind of gender-attribute-enhanced contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) method for SER. Specifically, we first construct an effective emotion CLAP (Emo-CLAP) for SER, using pre-trained text and audio encoders. Second, given the significance of gender information in SER, two novel multi-task learning based GEmo-CLAP (ML-GEmo-CLAP) and soft label based GEmo-CLAP (SL-GEmo-CLAP) models are further proposed to incorporate gender information of speech signals, forming more reasonable objectives. Experiments on IEMOCAP indicate that our proposed two GEmo-CLAPs consistently outperform Emo-CLAP with different pre-trained models. Remarkably, the proposed WavLM-based SL-GEmo-CLAP obtains the best UAR of 81.43% and WAR of 83.16%, which performs better than state-of-the-art SER methods by at least 3%. Our system is open-sourced on Github."
"Title: Federated Learning for Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Survey of Existing Approaches and Challenges
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used for key tasks in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), including perception, planning, and control. However, its reliance on vehicular data for model training presents significant challenges related to in-vehicle user privacy and communication overhead generated by massive data volumes. Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized ML approach that enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively develop models, broadening learning from various driving environments, enhancing overall performance, and simultaneously securing local vehicle data privacy and security. This survey paper presents a review of the advancements made in the application of FL for CAV (FL4CAV). First, centralized and decentralized frameworks of FL are analyzed, highlighting their key characteristics and methodologies. Second, diverse data sources, models, and data security techniques relevant to FL in CAVs are reviewed, emphasizing their significance in ensuring privacy and confidentiality. Third, specific and important applications of FL are explored, providing insight into the base models and datasets employed for each application. Finally, existing challenges for FL4CAV are listed and potential directions for future work are discussed to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of FL in the context of CAV.","Title: Human Sensing via Passive Spectrum Monitoring
Abstract: Human sensing is significantly improving our lifestyle in many fields such as elderly healthcare and public safety. Research has demonstrated that human activity can alter the passive radio frequency (PRF) spectrum, which represents the passive reception of RF signals in the surrounding environment without actively transmitting a target signal. This paper proposes a novel passive human sensing method that utilizes PRF spectrum alteration as a biometrics modality for human authentication, localization, and activity recognition. The proposed method uses software-defined radio (SDR) technology to acquire the PRF in the frequency band sensitive to human signature. Additionally, the PRF spectrum signatures are classified and regressed by five machine learning (ML) algorithms based on different human sensing tasks. The proposed Sensing Humans among Passive Radio Frequency (SHAPR) method was tested in several environments and scenarios, including a laboratory, a living room, a classroom, and a vehicle, to verify its extensiveness. The experimental results show that the SHAPR method achieved more than 95% accuracy in the four scenarios for the three human sensing tasks, with a localization error of less than 0.8 m. These results indicate that the SHAPR technique can be considered a new human signature modality with high accuracy, robustness, and general applicability."
"Title: Iterative Geometry Encoding Volume for Stereo Matching
Abstract: Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) has shown great potentials in matching tasks. However, all-pairs correlations lack non-local geometry knowledge and have difficulties tackling local ambiguities in ill-posed regions. In this paper, we propose Iterative Geometry Encoding Volume (IGEV-Stereo), a new deep network architecture for stereo matching. The proposed IGEV-Stereo builds a combined geometry encoding volume that encodes geometry and context information as well as local matching details, and iteratively indexes it to update the disparity map. To speed up the convergence, we exploit GEV to regress an accurate starting point for ConvGRUs iterations. Our IGEV-Stereo ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 and 2012 (Reflective) among all published methods and is the fastest among the top 10 methods. In addition, IGEV-Stereo has strong cross-dataset generalization as well as high inference efficiency. We also extend our IGEV to multi-view stereo (MVS), i.e. IGEV-MVS, which achieves competitive accuracy on DTU benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/gangweiX/IGEV.","Title: One at A Time: Multi-step Volumetric Probability Distribution Diffusion for Depth Estimation
Abstract: Recent works have explored the fundamental role of depth estimation in multi-view stereo (MVS) and semantic scene completion (SSC). They generally construct 3D cost volumes to explore geometric correspondence in depth, and estimate such volumes in a single step relying directly on the ground truth approximation. However, such problem cannot be thoroughly handled in one step due to complex empirical distributions, especially in challenging regions like occlusions, reflections, etc. In this paper, we formulate the depth estimation task as a multi-step distribution approximation process, and introduce a new paradigm of modeling the Volumetric Probability Distribution progressively (step-by-step) following a Markov chain with Diffusion models (VPDD). Specifically, to constrain the multi-step generation of volume in VPDD, we construct a meta volume guidance and a confidence-aware contextual guidance as conditional geometry priors to facilitate the distribution approximation. For the sampling process, we further investigate an online filtering strategy to maintain consistency in volume representations for stable training. Experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play VPDD outperforms the state-of-the-arts for tasks of MVS and SSC, and can also be easily extended to different baselines to get improvement. It is worth mentioning that we are the first camera-based work that surpasses LiDAR-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset."
"Title: In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism
Abstract: In-context learning is one of the surprising and useful features of large language models. How it works is an active area of research. Recently, stylized meta-learning-like setups have been devised that train these models on a sequence of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$ from a function class using the language modeling loss and observe generalization to unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several problems such as linear regression, trained transformers learn algorithms for learning functions in context. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution. It has been shown that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor for linear regression. In this paper, we show empirical evidence of transformers exhibiting the behavior of this ideal learner across different linear and non-linear function classes. We also extend the previous setups to work in the multitask setting and verify that transformers can do in-context learning in this setup as well and the Bayesian perspective sheds light on this setting also. Finally, via the example of learning Fourier series, we study the inductive bias for in-context learning. We find that in-context learning may or may not have simplicity bias depending on the pretraining data distribution.","Title: The No Free Lunch Theorem, Kolmogorov Complexity, and the Role of Inductive Biases in Machine Learning
Abstract: No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models."

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may hallucinate and generate fake information, despite pre-training on factual data. Inspired by the journalistic device of""according to sources"", we propose according-to prompting: directing LLMs to ground responses against previously observed text. To quantify this grounding, we propose a novel evaluation metric (QUIP-Score) that measures the extent to which model-produced answers are directly found in underlying text corpora. We illustrate with experiments on Wikipedia that these prompts improve grounding under our metrics, with the additional benefit of often improving end-task performance. Furthermore, prompts that ask the model to decrease grounding (or to ground to other corpora) decrease grounding, indicating the ability of language models to increase or decrease grounded generations on request."
"Title: Towards Trustable Skin Cancer Diagnosis via Rewriting Model's Decision
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated promising performance on image recognition tasks. However, they may heavily rely on confounding factors, using irrelevant artifacts or bias within the dataset as the cue to improve performance. When a model performs decision-making based on these spurious correlations, it can become untrustable and lead to catastrophic outcomes when deployed in the realworld scene. In this paper, we explore and try to solve this problem in the context of skin cancer diagnosis. We introduce a human-in-the-loop framework in the model training process such that users can observe and correct the model's decision logic when confounding behaviors happen. Specifically, our method can automatically discover confounding factors by analyzing the co-occurrence behavior of the samples. It is capable of learning confounding concepts using easily obtained concept exemplars. By mapping the black-box model's feature representation onto an explainable concept space, human users can interpret the concept and intervene via first order-logic instruction. We systematically evaluate our method on our newly crafted, well-controlled skin lesion dataset and several public skin lesion datasets. Experiments show that our method can effectively detect and remove confounding factors from datasets without any prior knowledge about the category distribution and does not require fully annotated concept labels. We also show that our method enables the model to focus on clinical-related concepts, improving the model's performance and trustworthiness during model inference.","Title: From Hope to Safety: Unlearning Biases of Deep Models by Enforcing the Right Reasons in Latent Space
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are prone to learning spurious correlations embedded in the training data, leading to potentially biased predictions. This poses risks when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications. Current methods for post-hoc model correction either require input-level annotations, which are only possible for spatially localized biases, or augment the latent feature space, thereby hoping to enforce the right reasons. We present a novel method ensuring the right reasons on the concept level by reducing the model's sensitivity towards biases through the gradient. When modeling biases via Concept Activation Vectors, we highlight the importance of choosing robust directions, as traditional regression-based approaches such as Support Vector Machines tend to result in diverging directions. We effectively mitigate biases in controlled and real-world settings on the ISIC, Bone Age, ImageNet and CelebA datasets using VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet architectures."
"Title: Structured Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A survey
Abstract: The remarkable performance of deep Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is generally attributed to their deeper and wider architectures, which can come with significant computational costs. Pruning neural networks has thus gained interest since it effectively lowers storage and computational costs. In contrast to weight pruning, which results in unstructured models, structured pruning provides the benefit of realistic acceleration by producing models that are friendly to hardware implementation. The special requirements of structured pruning have led to the discovery of numerous new challenges and the development of innovative solutions. This article surveys the recent progress towards structured pruning of deep CNNs. We summarize and compare the state-of-the-art structured pruning techniques with respect to filter ranking methods, regularization methods, dynamic execution, neural architecture search, the lottery ticket hypothesis, and the applications of pruning. While discussing structured pruning algorithms, we briefly introduce the unstructured pruning counterpart to emphasize their differences. Furthermore, we provide insights into potential research opportunities in the field of structured pruning.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer architecture is a deep learning model inspired by the success of the Transformer model in Natural Language Processing. However, the self-attention mechanism, large number of parameters, and the requirement for a substantial amount of training data still make Vision Transformers computationally burdensome. In this research, we investigate the possibility of applying Sparse Regularization to Vision Transformers and the impact of Pruning, either after Sparse Regularization or without it, on the trade-off between performance and efficiency. To accomplish this, we apply Sparse Regularization and Pruning methods to the Vision Transformer architecture for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 datasets. The training process for the Vision Transformer model consists of two parts: pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training utilizes ImageNet21K data, followed by fine-tuning for 20 epochs. The results show that when testing with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 data, models with Sparse Regularization can increase accuracy by 0.12%. Furthermore, applying pruning to models with Sparse Regularization yields even better results. Specifically, it increases the average accuracy by 0.568% on CIFAR-10 data, 1.764% on CIFAR-100, and 0.256% on ImageNet-100 data compared to pruning models without Sparse Regularization.

"Title: Adversarial alignment: Breaking the trade-off between the strength of an attack and its relevance to human perception
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to have a fundamental sensitivity to adversarial attacks, perturbations of the input that are imperceptible to humans yet powerful enough to change the visual decision of a model. Adversarial attacks have long been considered the""Achilles' heel""of deep learning, which may eventually force a shift in modeling paradigms. Nevertheless, the formidable capabilities of modern large-scale DNNs have somewhat eclipsed these early concerns. Do adversarial attacks continue to pose a threat to DNNs? Here, we investigate how the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks has evolved as their accuracy on ImageNet has continued to improve. We measure adversarial robustness in two different ways: First, we measure the smallest adversarial attack needed to cause a model to change its object categorization decision. Second, we measure how aligned successful attacks are with the features that humans find diagnostic for object recognition. We find that adversarial attacks are inducing bigger and more easily detectable changes to image pixels as DNNs grow better on ImageNet, but these attacks are also becoming less aligned with features that humans find diagnostic for recognition. To better understand the source of this trade-off, we turn to the neural harmonizer, a DNN training routine that encourages models to leverage the same features as humans to solve tasks. Harmonized DNNs achieve the best of both worlds and experience attacks that are detectable and affect features that humans find diagnostic for recognition, meaning that attacks on these models are more likely to be rendered ineffective by inducing similar effects on human perception. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of DNNs to adversarial attacks can be mitigated by DNN scale, data scale, and training routines that align models with biological intelligence.","Title: EVA-02: A Visual Representation for Neon Genesis

"Title: Text2Seg: Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation via Text-Guided Visual Foundation Models
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA, have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Similarly, in the field of visual learning, models like Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have exhibited remarkable progress in open-set detection and instance segmentation tasks. It is undeniable that these FMs will profoundly impact a wide range of real-world visual learning tasks, ushering in a new paradigm shift for developing such models. In this study, we concentrate on the remote sensing domain, where the images are notably dissimilar from those in conventional scenarios. We developed a pipeline that leverages multiple FMs to facilitate remote sensing image semantic segmentation tasks guided by text prompt, which we denote as Text2Seg. The pipeline is benchmarked on several widely-used remote sensing datasets, and we present preliminary results to demonstrate its effectiveness. Through this work, we aim to provide insights into maximizing the applicability of visual FMs in specific contexts with minimal model tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Douglas2Code/Text2Seg.","Title: Domain Specialization as the Key to Make Large Language Models Disruptive: A Comprehensive Survey
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing a highly useful, task-agnostic foundation for a wide range of applications. However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges. Last, we offer our insights into the current research status and future trends in this area."
"Title: Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning for Generalizable Vision-Language Models
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, working with manually designed prompts have demonstrated great capacity of transfer learning. Recently, learnable prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance, which however are prone to overfit to seen classes, failing to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning (KAPT) framework for vision-language models. Our approach takes inspiration from human intelligence in which external knowledge is usually incorporated into recognizing novel categories of objects. Specifically, we design two complementary types of knowledge-aware prompts for the text encoder to leverage the distinctive characteristics of category-related external knowledge. The discrete prompt extracts the key information from descriptions of an object category, and the learned continuous prompt captures overall contexts. We further design an adaptation head for the visual encoder to aggregate salient attentive visual cues, which establishes discriminative and task-aware visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmark datasets and the results verify the effectiveness in few-shot image classification, especially in generalizing to unseen categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art CoCoOp method, KAPT exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.22% on new classes and 2.57% in terms of harmonic mean.","Title: π-Tuning: Transferring Multimodal Foundation Models with Optimal Multi-task Interpolation
Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great advances in multi-task learning with a unified interface of unimodal and multimodal tasks. However, the potential of such multi-task learners has not been exploited during transfer learning. In this work, we present a universal parameter-efficient transfer learning method, termed Predict-Interpolate Tuning ($\pi$-Tuning), for vision, language, and vision-language tasks. It aggregates the parameters of lightweight task-specific experts learned from similar tasks to aid the target downstream task. The task similarities are predicted in a unified modality-independent space, yielding a scalable graph to demonstrate task relationships. $\pi$-Tuning has several appealing benefits. First, it flexibly explores both intra- and inter-modal transferability between similar tasks to improve the accuracy and robustness of transfer learning, especially in data-scarce scenarios. Second, it offers a systematical solution for transfer learning with multi-task prediction-and-then-interpolation, compatible with diverse types of parameter-efficient experts, such as prompt and adapter. Third, an extensive study of task-level mutual benefits on 14 unimodal and 6 multimodal datasets shows that $\pi$-Tuning surpasses fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods both in full-shot and low-shot regimes. The task graph also enables an in-depth interpretable analysis of task transferability across modalities. The code will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/pi-Tuning."
"Title: ISBNet: a 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation Network with Instance-aware Sampling and Box-aware Dynamic Convolution
Abstract: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods are predominated by the bottom-up design - manually fine-tuned algorithm to group points into clusters followed by a refinement network. However, by relying on the quality of the clusters, these methods generate susceptible results when (1) nearby objects with the same semantic class are packed together, or (2) large objects with loosely connected regions. To address these limitations, we introduce ISBNet, a novel cluster-free method that represents instances as kernels and decodes instance masks via dynamic convolution. To efficiently generate high-recall and discriminative kernels, we propose a simple strategy named Instance-aware Farthest Point Sampling to sample candidates and leverage the local aggregation layer inspired by PointNet++ to encode candidate features. Moreover, we show that predicting and leveraging the 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes in the dynamic convolution further boosts performance. Our method set new state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 (55.9), S3DIS (60.8), and STPLS3D (49.2) in terms of AP and retains fast inference time (237ms per scene on Scan-NetV2). The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/ISBNet.","Title: GaPro: Box-Supervised 3D Point Cloud Instance Segmentation Using Gaussian Processes as Pseudo Labelers
Abstract: Instance segmentation on 3D point clouds (3DIS) is a longstanding challenge in computer vision, where state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on full supervision. As annotating ground truth dense instance masks is tedious and expensive, solving 3DIS with weak supervision has become more practical. In this paper, we propose GaPro, a new instance segmentation for 3D point clouds using axis-aligned 3D bounding box supervision. Our two-step approach involves generating pseudo labels from box annotations and training a 3DIS network with the resulting labels. Additionally, we employ the self-training strategy to improve the performance of our method further. We devise an effective Gaussian Process to generate pseudo instance masks from the bounding boxes and resolve ambiguities when they overlap, resulting in pseudo instance masks with their uncertainty values. Our experiments show that GaPro outperforms previous weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation methods and has competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art fully supervised ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach, where we can adapt various state-of-the-art fully supervised methods to the weak supervision task by using our pseudo labels for training. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/GaPro."
"Title: Tracking Everything Everywhere All at Once
Abstract: We present a new test-time optimization method for estimating dense and long-range motion from a video sequence. Prior optical flow or particle video tracking algorithms typically operate within limited temporal windows, struggling to track through occlusions and maintain global consistency of estimated motion trajectories. We propose a complete and globally consistent motion representation, dubbed OmniMotion, that allows for accurate, full-length motion estimation of every pixel in a video. OmniMotion represents a video using a quasi-3D canonical volume and performs pixel-wise tracking via bijections between local and canonical space. This representation allows us to ensure global consistency, track through occlusions, and model any combination of camera and object motion. Extensive evaluations on the TAP-Vid benchmark and real-world footage show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively. See our project page for more results: http://omnimotion.github.io/","Title: Segment Anything Meets Point Tracking
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has established itself as a powerful zero-shot image segmentation model, employing interactive prompts such as points to generate masks. This paper presents SAM-PT, a method extending SAM's capability to tracking and segmenting anything in dynamic videos. SAM-PT leverages robust and sparse point selection and propagation techniques for mask generation, demonstrating that a SAM-based segmentation tracker can yield strong zero-shot performance across popular video object segmentation benchmarks, including DAVIS, YouTube-VOS, and MOSE. Compared to traditional object-centric mask propagation strategies, we uniquely use point propagation to exploit local structure information that is agnostic to object semantics. We highlight the merits of point-based tracking through direct evaluation on the zero-shot open-world Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. To further enhance our approach, we utilize K-Medoids clustering for point initialization and track both positive and negative points to clearly distinguish the target object. We also employ multiple mask decoding passes for mask refinement and devise a point re-initialization strategy to improve tracking accuracy. Our code integrates different point trackers and video segmentation benchmarks and will be released at https://github.com/SysCV/sam-pt."
"Title: Transformers in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey
Abstract: Transformers have significantly impacted domains like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, where they improve performance compared to other neural networks. This survey explores how transformers are used in reinforcement learning (RL), where they are seen as a promising solution for addressing challenges such as unstable training, credit assignment, lack of interpretability, and partial observability. We begin by providing a brief domain overview of RL, followed by a discussion on the challenges of classical RL algorithms. Next, we delve into the properties of the transformer and its variants and discuss the characteristics that make them well-suited to address the challenges inherent in RL. We examine the application of transformers to various aspects of RL, including representation learning, transition and reward function modeling, and policy optimization. We also discuss recent research that aims to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of transformers in RL, using visualization techniques and efficient training strategies. Often, the transformer architecture must be tailored to the specific needs of a given application. We present a broad overview of how transformers have been adapted for several applications, including robotics, medicine, language modeling, cloud computing, and combinatorial optimization. We conclude by discussing the limitations of using transformers in RL and assess their potential for catalyzing future breakthroughs in this field.","Title: Risk Sensitive Dead-end Identification in Safety-Critical Offline Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: In safety-critical decision-making scenarios being able to identify worst-case outcomes, or dead-ends is crucial in order to develop safe and reliable policies in practice. These situations are typically rife with uncertainty due to unknown or stochastic characteristics of the environment as well as limited offline training data. As a result, the value of a decision at any time point should be based on the distribution of its anticipated effects. We propose a framework to identify worst-case decision points, by explicitly estimating distributions of the expected return of a decision. These estimates enable earlier indication of dead-ends in a manner that is tunable based on the risk tolerance of the designed task. We demonstrate the utility of Distributional Dead-end Discovery (DistDeD) in a toy domain as well as when assessing the risk of severely ill patients in the intensive care unit reaching a point where death is unavoidable. We find that DistDeD significantly improves over prior discovery approaches, providing indications of the risk 10 hours earlier on average as well as increasing detection by 20%."
"Title: Grounding 3D Object Affordance from 2D Interactions in Images
Abstract: Grounding 3D object affordance seeks to locate objects' ''action possibilities'' regions in the 3D space, which serves as a link between perception and operation for embodied agents. Existing studies primarily focus on connecting visual affordances with geometry structures, e.g. relying on annotations to declare interactive regions of interest on the object and establishing a mapping between the regions and affordances. However, the essence of learning object affordance is to understand how to use it, and the manner that detaches interactions is limited in generalization. Normally, humans possess the ability to perceive object affordances in the physical world through demonstration images or videos. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task setting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images, which faces the challenge of anticipating affordance through interactions of different sources. To address this problem, we devise a novel Interaction-driven 3D Affordance Grounding Network (IAG), which aligns the region feature of objects from different sources and models the interactive contexts for 3D object affordance grounding. Besides, we collect a Point-Image Affordance Dataset (PIAD) to support the proposed task. Comprehensive experiments on PIAD demonstrate the reliability of the proposed task and the superiority of our method. The project is available at https://github.com/yyvhang/IAGNet.","Title: RealFusion 360° Reconstruction of Any Object from a Single Image
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a full 360° photographic model of an object from a single image of it. We do so by fitting a neural radiance field to the image, but find this problem to be severely ill-posed. We thus take an off-the-self conditional image generator based on diffusion and engineer a prompt that encourages it to “dream up” novel views of the object. Using the recent DreamFusion method, we fuse the given input view, the conditional prior, and other regularizers into a final, consistent reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction results on benchmark images when compared to prior methods for monocular 3D reconstruction of objects. Qualitatively, our reconstructions provide a faithful match of the input view and a plausible extrapolation of its appearance and 3D shape, including to the side of the object not visible in the image."
"Title: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation with Semantics-prototype Learning
Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) parses objects and predicts their relationships (predicate) to connect human language and visual scenes. However, different language preferences of annotators and semantic overlaps between predicates lead to biased predicate annotations in the dataset, i.e. different predicates for same object pairs. Biased predicate annotations make PSG models struggle in constructing a clear decision plane among predicates, which greatly hinders the real application of PSG models. To address the intrinsic bias above, we propose a novel framework named ADTrans to adaptively transfer biased predicate annotations to informative and unified ones. To promise consistency and accuracy during the transfer process, we propose to measure the invariance of representations in each predicate class, and learn unbiased prototypes of predicates with different intensities. Meanwhile, we continuously measure the distribution changes between each presentation and its prototype, and constantly screen potential biased data. Finally, with the unbiased predicate-prototype representation embedding space, biased annotations are easily identified. Experiments show that ADTrans significantly improves the performance of benchmark models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance, and shows great generalization and effectiveness on multiple datasets.","Title: Generating Visual Spatial Description via Holistic 3D Scene Understanding
Abstract: Visual spatial description (VSD) aims to generate texts that describe the spatial relations of the given objects within images. Existing VSD work merely models the 2D geometrical vision features, thus inevitably falling prey to the problem of skewed spatial understanding of target objects. In this work, we investigate the incorporation of 3D scene features for VSD. With an external 3D scene extractor, we obtain the 3D objects and scene features for input images, based on which we construct a target object-centered 3D spatial scene graph (Go3D-S2G), such that we model the spatial semantics of target objects within the holistic 3D scenes. Besides, we propose a scene subgraph selecting mechanism, sampling topologically-diverse subgraphs from Go3D-S2G, where the diverse local structure features are navigated to yield spatially-diversified text generation. Experimental results on two VSD datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines significantly, especially improving on the cases with complex visual spatial relations. Meanwhile, our method can produce more spatially-diversified generation."
"Title: InterDiff: Generating 3D Human-Object Interactions with Physics-Informed Diffusion
Abstract: This paper addresses a novel task of anticipating 3D human-object interactions (HOIs). Most existing research on HOI synthesis lacks comprehensive whole-body interactions with dynamic objects, e.g., often limited to manipulating small or static objects. Our task is significantly more challenging, as it requires modeling dynamic objects with various shapes, capturing whole-body motion, and ensuring physically valid interactions. To this end, we propose InterDiff, a framework comprising two key steps: (i) interaction diffusion, where we leverage a diffusion model to encode the distribution of future human-object interactions; (ii) interaction correction, where we introduce a physics-informed predictor to correct denoised HOIs in a diffusion step. Our key insight is to inject prior knowledge that the interactions under reference with respect to contact points follow a simple pattern and are easily predictable. Experiments on multiple human-object interaction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for this task, capable of producing realistic, vivid, and remarkably long-term 3D HOI predictions.","Title: Diagnosing Human-object Interaction Detectors
Abstract: Although we have witnessed significant progress in human-object interaction (HOI) detection with increasingly high mAP (mean Average Precision), a single mAP score is too concise to obtain an informative summary of a model's performance and to understand why one approach is better than another. In this paper, we introduce a diagnosis toolbox for analyzing the error sources of the existing HOI detection models. We first conduct holistic investigations in the pipeline of HOI detection, consisting of human-object pair detection and then interaction classification. We define a set of errors and the oracles to fix each of them. By measuring the mAP improvement obtained from fixing an error using its oracle, we can have a detailed analysis of the significance of different errors. We then delve into the human-object detection and interaction classification, respectively, and check the model's behavior. For the first detection task, we investigate both recall and precision, measuring the coverage of ground-truth human-object pairs as well as the noisiness level in the detections. For the second classification task, we compute mAP for interaction classification only, without considering the detection scores. We also measure the performance of the models in differentiating human-object pairs with and without actual interactions using the AP (Average Precision) score. Our toolbox is applicable for different methods across different datasets and available at https://github.com/neu-vi/Diag-HOI."
"Title: Contrastive Latent Space Reconstruction Learning for Audio-Text Retrieval
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) has been extensively applied in various domains, such as multimedia search engines and recommendation systems. Most existing CMR methods focus on image-to-text retrieval, whereas audio-to-text retrieval, a less explored domain, has posed a great challenge due to the difficulty to uncover discriminative features from audio clips and texts. Existing studies are restricted in the following two ways: 1) Most researchers utilize contrastive learning to construct a common subspace where similarities among data can be measured. However, they considers only cross-modal transformation, neglecting the intra-modal separability. Besides, the temperature parameter is not adaptively adjusted along with semantic guidance, which degrades the performance. 2) These methods do not take latent representation reconstruction into account, which is essential for semantic alignment. This paper introduces a novel audio-text oriented CMR approach, termed Contrastive Latent Space Reconstruction Learning (CLSR). CLSR improves contrastive representation learning by taking intra-modal separability into account and adopting an adaptive temperature control strategy. Moreover, the latent representation reconstruction modules are embedded into the CMR framework, which improves modal interaction. Experiments in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods on two audio-text datasets have validated the superiority of CLSR.","Title: Improving Text-Audio Retrieval by Text-aware Attention Pooling and Prior Matrix Revised Loss
Abstract: In text-audio retrieval (TAR) tasks, due to the heterogeneity of contents between text and audio, the semantic information contained in the text is only similar to certain frames within the audio. Yet, existing works aggregate the entire audio without considering the text, such as mean-pooling over the frames, which is likely to encode misleading audio information not described in the given text. In this paper, we present a text-aware attention pooling (TAP) module for TAR, which is essentially a scaled dot product attention for a text to attend to its most semantically similar frames. Furthermore, previous methods only conduct the softmax for every single-side retrieval, ignoring the potential cross-retrieval information. By exploring the intrinsic prior of each text-audio pair, we introduce a prior matrix revised (PMR) loss to filter the hard case with high (or low) text-to-audio but low (or high) audio-to-text similarity scores, thus achieving the dual optimal match. Experiments show that our TAP significantly outperforms various text-agnostic pooling functions. Moreover, our PMR loss also shows stable performance gains on multiple datasets."
"Title: Local Boosting for Weakly-Supervised Learning
Abstract: Boosting is a commonly used technique to enhance the performance of a set of base models by combining them into a strong ensemble model. Though widely adopted, boosting is typically used in supervised learning where the data is labeled accurately. However, in weakly supervised learning, where most of the data is labeled through weak and noisy sources, it remains nontrivial to design effective boosting approaches. In this work, we show that the standard implementation of the convex combination of base learners can hardly work due to the presence of noisy labels. Instead, we propose LocalBoost, a novel framework for weakly-supervised boosting. LocalBoost iteratively boosts the ensemble model from two dimensions, i.e., intra-source and inter-source. The intra-source boosting introduces locality to the base learners and enables each base learner to focus on a particular feature regime by training new base learners on granularity-varying error regions. For the inter-source boosting, we leverage a conditional function to indicate the weak source where the sample is more likely to appear. To account for the weak labels, we further design an estimate-then-modify approach to compute the model weights. Experiments on seven datasets show that our method significantly outperforms vanilla boosting methods and other weakly-supervised methods.","Title: R-Mixup: Riemannian Mixup for Biological Networks
Abstract: Biological networks are commonly used in biomedical and healthcare domains to effectively model the structure of complex biological systems with interactions linking biological entities. However, due to their characteristics of high dimensionality and low sample size, directly applying deep learning models on biological networks usually faces severe overfitting. In this work, we propose R-MIXUP, a Mixup-based data augmentation technique that suits the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of adjacency matrices from biological networks with optimized training efficiency. The interpolation process in R-MIXUP leverages the log-Euclidean distance metrics from the Riemannian manifold, effectively addressing the swelling effect and arbitrarily incorrect label issues of vanilla Mixup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-MIXUP with five real-world biological network datasets on both regression and classification tasks. Besides, we derive a commonly ignored necessary condition for identifying the SPD matrices of biological networks and empirically study its influence on the model performance. The code implementation can be found in Appendix D."
"Title: A Survey on Audio Diffusion Models: Text To Speech Synthesis and Enhancement in Generative AI
Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated impressive performance in various fields, among which speech synthesis is an interesting direction. With the diffusion model as the most popular generative model, numerous works have attempted two active tasks: text to speech and speech enhancement. This work conducts a survey on audio diffusion model, which is complementary to existing surveys that either lack the recent progress of diffusion-based speech synthesis or highlight an overall picture of applying diffusion model in multiple fields. Specifically, this work first briefly introduces the background of audio and diffusion model. As for the text-to-speech task, we divide the methods into three categories based on the stage where diffusion model is adopted: acoustic model, vocoder and end-to-end framework. Moreover, we categorize various speech enhancement tasks by either certain signals are removed or added into the input speech. Comparisons of experimental results and discussions are also covered in this survey.","Title: QS-TTS: Towards Semi-Supervised Text-to-Speech Synthesis via Vector-Quantized Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised TTS framework, QS-TTS, to improve TTS quality with lower supervised data requirements via Vector-Quantized Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning (VQ-S3RL) utilizing more unlabeled speech audio. This framework comprises two VQ-S3R learners: first, the principal learner aims to provide a generative Multi-Stage Multi-Codebook (MSMC) VQ-S3R via the MSMC-VQ-GAN combined with the contrastive S3RL, while decoding it back to the high-quality audio; then, the associate learner further abstracts the MSMC representation into a highly-compact VQ representation through a VQ-VAE. These two generative VQ-S3R learners provide profitable speech representations and pre-trained models for TTS, significantly improving synthesis quality with the lower requirement for supervised data. QS-TTS is evaluated comprehensively under various scenarios via subjective and objective tests in experiments. The results powerfully demonstrate the superior performance of QS-TTS, winning the highest MOS over supervised or semi-supervised baseline TTS approaches, especially in low-resource scenarios. Moreover, comparing various speech representations and transfer learning methods in TTS further validates the notable improvement of the proposed VQ-S3RL to TTS, showing the best audio quality and intelligibility metrics. The trend of slower decay in the synthesis quality of QS-TTS with decreasing supervised data further highlights its lower requirements for supervised data, indicating its great potential in low-resource scenarios."
"Title: Anomaly Detection with Variance Stabilized Density Estimation
Abstract: Density estimation based anomaly detection schemes typically model anomalies as examples that reside in low-density regions. We propose a modified density estimation problem and demonstrate its effectiveness for anomaly detection. Specifically, we assume the density function of normal samples is uniform in some compact domain. This assumption implies the density function is more stable (with lower variance) around normal samples than anomalies. We first corroborate this assumption empirically using a wide range of real-world data. Then, we design a variance stabilized density estimation problem for maximizing the likelihood of the observed samples while minimizing the variance of the density around normal samples. We introduce an ensemble of autoregressive models to learn the variance stabilized distribution. Finally, we perform an extensive benchmark with 52 datasets demonstrating that our method leads to state-of-the-art results while alleviating the need for data-specific hyperparameter tuning.","Title: UADB: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Booster
Abstract: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is a key data mining problem owing to its wide real-world applications. Due to the complete absence of supervision signals, UAD methods rely on implicit assumptions about anomalous patterns (e.g., scattered/sparsely/densely clustered) to detect anomalies. However, real-world data are complex and vary significantly across different domains. No single assumption can describe such complexity and be valid in all scenarios. This is also confirmed by recent research that shows no UAD method is omnipotent [1]. Based on above observations, instead of searching for a magic universal winner assumption, we seek to design a general UAD Booster (UADB) that empowers any UAD models with adaptability to different data. This is a challenging task given the heterogeneous model structures and assumptions adopted by existing UAD methods. To achieve this, we dive deep into the UAD problem and find that compared to normal data, anomalies (i) lack clear structure/pattern in feature space, thus (ii) harder to learn by model without a suitable assumption, and finally, leads to (iii) high variance between different learners. In light of these findings, we propose to (i) distill the knowledge of the source UAD model to an imitation learner (booster) that holds no data assumption, then (ii) exploit the variance between them to perform automatic correction, and thus (iii) improve the booster over the original UAD model. We use a neural network as the booster for its strong expressive power as a universal approximator and ability to perform flexible posthoc tuning. Note that UADB is a model-agnostic framework that can enhance heterogeneous UAD models in a unified way. Extensive experiments on over 80 tabular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UADB. To facilitate further research, code, figures, and datasets are available at UADB’s Github repository 1."
"Title: LaplacianFusion
Abstract: We propose LaplacianFusion, a novel approach that reconstructs detailed and controllable 3D clothed-human body shapes from an input depth or 3D point cloud sequence. The key idea of our approach is to use Laplacian coordinates, well-known differential coordinates that have been used for mesh editing, for representing the local structures contained in the input scans, instead of implicit 3D functions or vertex displacements used previously. Our approach reconstructs a controllable base mesh using SMPL, and learns a surface function that predicts Laplacian coordinates representing surface details on the base mesh. For a given pose, we first build and subdivide a base mesh, which is a deformed SMPL template, and then estimate Laplacian coordinates for the mesh vertices using the surface function. The final reconstruction for the pose is obtained by integrating the estimated Laplacian coordinates as a whole. Experimental results show that our approach based on Laplacian coordinates successfully reconstructs more visually pleasing shape details than previous methods. The approach also enables various surface detail manipulations, such as detail transfer and enhancement.","Title: Stable and Consistent Prediction of 3D Characteristic Orientation via Invariant Residual Learning
Abstract: Learning to predict reliable characteristic orientations of 3D point clouds is an important yet challenging problem, as different point clouds of the same class may have largely varying appearances. In this work, we introduce a novel method to decouple the shape geometry and semantics of the input point cloud to achieve both stability and consistency. The proposed method integrates shape-geometry-based SO(3)-equivariant learning and shape-semantics-based SO(3)-invariant residual learning, where a final characteristic orientation is obtained by calibrating an SO(3)-equivariant orientation hypothesis using an SO(3)-invariant residual rotation. In experiments, the proposed method not only demonstrates superior stability and consistency but also exhibits state-of-the-art performances when applied to point cloud part segmentation, given randomly rotated inputs."
"Title: EdgeServe: A Streaming System for Decentralized Model Serving
Abstract: The relevant features for a machine learning task may be aggregated from data sources collected on different nodes in a network. This problem, which we call decentralized prediction, creates a number of interesting systems challenges in managing data routing, placing computation, and time-synchronization. This paper presents EdgeServe, a machine learning system that can serve decentralized predictions. EdgeServe relies on a low-latency message broker to route data through a network to nodes that can serve predictions. EdgeServe relies on a series of novel optimizations that can tradeoff computation, communication, and accuracy. We evaluate EdgeServe on three decentralized prediction tasks: (1) multi-camera object tracking, (2) network intrusion detection, and (3) human activity recognition.","Title: Streaming Video Model
Abstract: Video understanding tasks have traditionally been modeled by two separate architectures, specially tailored for two distinct tasks. Sequence-based video tasks, such as action recognition, use a video backbone to directly extract spatiotemporal features, while frame-based video tasks, such as multiple object tracking (MOT), rely on single fixed-image backbone to extract spatial features. In contrast, we propose to unify video understanding tasks into one novel streaming video architecture, referred to as Streaming Vision Transformer (S-ViT). S-ViT first produces frame-level features with a memory-enabled temporally-aware spatial encoder to serve the frame-based video tasks. Then the frame features are input into a task-related temporal decoder to obtain spatiotemporal features for sequence-based tasks. The efficiency and efficacy of S-ViT is demonstrated by the state-of-the-art accuracy in the sequence-based action recognition task and the competitive advantage over conventional architecture in the frame-based MOT task. We believe that the concept of streaming video model and the implementation of S-ViT are solid steps towards a unified deep learning architecture for video understanding. Code will be available at https://github.com/yuzhms/Streaming-Video-Model."
"Title: Tailoring Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation Quality Estimation
Abstract: While quality estimation (QE) can play an important role in the translation process, its effectiveness relies on the availability and quality of training data. For QE in particular, high-quality labeled data is often lacking due to the high-cost and effort associated with labeling such data. Aside from the data scarcity challenge, QE models should also be generalizabile, i.e., they should be able to handle data from different domains, both generic and specific. To alleviate these two main issues — data scarcity and domain mismatch — this paper combines domain adaptation and data augmentation within a robust QE system. Our method is to first train a generic QE model and then fine-tune it on a specific domain while retaining generic knowledge. Our results show a significant improvement for all the language pairs investigated, better cross-lingual inference, and a superior performance in zero-shot learning scenarios as compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","Title: Poor Man’s Quality Estimation: Predicting Reference-Based MT Metrics Without the Reference
Abstract: Machine translation quality estimation (QE) predicts human judgements of a translation hypothesis without seeing the reference. State-of-the-art QE systems based on pretrained language models have been achieving remarkable correlations with human judgements yet they are computationally heavy and require human annotations, which are slow and expensive to create. To address these limitations, we define the problem of metric estimation (ME) where one predicts the automated metric scores also without the reference. We show that even without access to the reference, our model can estimate automated metrics (ρ = 60% for BLEU, ρ = 51% for other metrics) at the sentence-level. Because automated metrics correlate with human judgements, we can leverage the ME task for pre-training a QE model. For the QE task, we find that pre-training on TER is better (ρ = 23%) than training for scratch (ρ = 20%)."
"Title: SLoRA: Federated Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models
Abstract: Transfer learning via fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models has gained significant success in delivering state-of-the-art results across various NLP tasks. In the absence of centralized data, Federated Learning (FL) can benefit from distributed and private data of the FL edge clients for fine-tuning. However, due to the limited communication, computation, and storage capabilities of edge devices and the huge sizes of popular transformer models, efficient fine-tuning is crucial to make federated training feasible. This work explores the opportunities and challenges associated with applying parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in different FL settings for language tasks. Specifically, our investigation reveals that as the data across users becomes more diverse, the gap between fully fine-tuning the model and employing PEFT methods widens. To bridge this performance gap, we propose a method called SLoRA, which overcomes the key limitations of LoRA in high heterogeneous data scenarios through a novel data-driven initialization technique. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLoRA achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning, with significant sparse updates with approximately $\sim 1\%$ density while reducing training time by up to $90\%$.","Title: AutoPEFT: Automatic Configuration Search for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Abstract: Large pretrained language models are widely used in downstream NLP tasks via task-specific fine-tuning, but such procedures can be costly. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have achieved strong task performance while updating a much smaller number of parameters compared to full model fine-tuning (FFT). However, it is non-trivial to make informed design choices on the PEFT configurations, such as their architecture, the number of tunable parameters, and even the layers in which the PEFT modules are inserted. Consequently, it is highly likely that the current, manually designed configurations are suboptimal in terms of their performance-efficiency trade-off. Inspired by advances in neural architecture search, we propose AutoPEFT for automatic PEFT configuration selection: we first design an expressive configuration search space with multiple representative PEFT modules as building blocks. Using multi-objective Bayesian optimisation in a low-cost setup, we then discover a Pareto-optimal set of configurations with strong performance-cost trade-offs across different numbers of parameters that are also highly transferable across different tasks. Empirically, on GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks, we show that AutoPEFT-discovered configurations significantly outperform existing PEFT methods and are on par or better than FFT, without incurring substantial training efficiency costs."

Abstract: We present a novel model for Tracking Any Point (TAP) that effectively tracks any queried point on any physical surface throughout a video sequence. Our approach employs two stages: (1) a matching stage, which independently locates a suitable candidate point match for the query point on every other frame, and (2) a refinement stage, which updates both the trajectory and query features based on local correlations. The resulting model surpasses all baseline methods by a significant margin on the TAP-Vid benchmark, as demonstrated by an approximate 20% absolute average Jaccard (AJ) improvement on DAVIS. Our model facilitates fast inference on long and high-resolution video sequences. On a modern GPU, our implementation has the capacity to track points faster than real-time, and can be flexibly extended to higher-resolution videos. Given the high-quality trajectories extracted from a large dataset, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept diffusion model which generates trajectories from static images, enabling plausible animations. Visualizations, source code, and pretrained models can be found on our project webpage."
"Title: LLM Censorship: A Machine Learning Challenge or a Computer Security Problem?
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in comprehending complex instructions. However, their blind adherence to provided instructions has led to concerns regarding risks of malicious use. Existing defence mechanisms, such as model fine-tuning or output censorship using LLMs, have proven to be fallible, as LLMs can still generate problematic responses. Commonly employed censorship approaches treat the issue as a machine learning problem and rely on another LM to detect undesirable content in LLM outputs. In this paper, we present the theoretical limitations of such semantic censorship approaches. Specifically, we demonstrate that semantic censorship can be perceived as an undecidable problem, highlighting the inherent challenges in censorship that arise due to LLMs' programmatic and instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the challenges extend beyond semantic censorship, as knowledgeable attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from a collection of permissible ones. As a result, we propose that the problem of censorship needs to be reevaluated; it should be treated as a security problem which warrants the adaptation of security-based approaches to mitigate potential risks.","Title: Eliciting Latent Predictions from Transformers with the Tuned Lens
Abstract: We analyze transformers from the perspective of iterative inference, seeking to understand how model predictions are refined layer by layer. To do so, we train an affine probe for each block in a frozen pretrained model, making it possible to decode every hidden state into a distribution over the vocabulary. Our method, the tuned lens, is a refinement of the earlier""logit lens""technique, which yielded useful insights but is often brittle. We test our method on various autoregressive language models with up to 20B parameters, showing it to be more predictive, reliable and unbiased than the logit lens. With causal experiments, we show the tuned lens uses similar features to the model itself. We also find the trajectory of latent predictions can be used to detect malicious inputs with high accuracy. All code needed to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens."
"Title: CATR: Combinatorial-Dependence Audio-Queried Transformer for Audio-Visual Video Segmentation
Abstract: Audio-visual video segmentation~(AVVS) aims to generate pixel-level maps of sound-producing objects within image frames and ensure the maps faithfully adhere to the given audio, such as identifying and segmenting a singing person in a video. However, existing methods exhibit two limitations: 1) they address video temporal features and audio-visual interactive features separately, disregarding the inherent spatial-temporal dependence of combined audio and video, and 2) they inadequately introduce audio constraints and object-level information during the decoding stage, resulting in segmentation outcomes that fail to comply with audio directives. To tackle these issues, we propose a decoupled audio-video transformer that combines audio and video features from their respective temporal and spatial dimensions, capturing their combined dependence. To optimize memory consumption, we design a block, which, when stacked, enables capturing audio-visual fine-grained combinatorial-dependence in a memory-efficient manner. Additionally, we introduce audio-constrained queries during the decoding phase. These queries contain rich object-level information, ensuring the decoded mask adheres to the sounds. Experimental results confirm our approach's effectiveness, with our framework achieving a new SOTA performance on all three datasets using two backbones. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/aspirinone/CATR.github.io}","Title: JOTR: 3D Joint Contrastive Learning with Transformers for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the problem of 3D human mesh recovery from a single image under obscured conditions. Most state-of-the-art methods aim to improve 2D alignment technologies, such as spatial averaging and 2D joint sampling. However, they tend to neglect the crucial aspect of 3D alignment by improving 3D representations. Furthermore, recent methods struggle to separate the target human from occlusion or background in crowded scenes as they optimize the 3D space of target human with 3D joint coordinates as local supervision. To address these issues, a desirable method would involve a framework for fusing 2D and 3D features and a strategy for optimizing the 3D space globally. Therefore, this paper presents 3D JOint contrastive learning with TRansformers (JOTR) framework for handling occluded 3D human mesh recovery. Our method includes an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to fuse 2D and 3D representations for achieving 2D$\&$3D aligned results in a coarse-to-fine manner and a novel 3D joint contrastive learning approach for adding explicitly global supervision for the 3D feature space. The contrastive learning approach includes two contrastive losses: joint-to-joint contrast for enhancing the similarity of semantically similar voxels (i.e., human joints), and joint-to-non-joint contrast for ensuring discrimination from others (e.g., occlusions and background). Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on both occlusion-specific and standard benchmarks, significantly improving the reconstruction of occluded humans."
"Title: How to Train Your DRAGON: Diverse Augmentation Towards Generalizable Dense Retrieval
Abstract: Various techniques have been developed in recent years to improve dense retrieval (DR), such as unsupervised contrastive learning and pseudo-query generation. Existing DRs, however, often suffer from effectiveness tradeoffs between supervised and zero-shot retrieval, which some argue was due to the limited model capacity. We contradict this hypothesis and show that a generalizable DR can be trained to achieve high accuracy in both supervised and zero-shot retrieval without increasing model size. In particular, we systematically examine the contrastive learning of DRs, under the framework of Data Augmentation (DA). Our study shows that common DA practices such as query augmentation with generative models and pseudo-relevance label creation using a cross-encoder, are often inefficient and sub-optimal. We hence propose a new DA approach with diverse queries and sources of supervision to progressively train a generalizable DR. As a result, DRAGON, our dense retriever trained with diverse augmentation, is the first BERT-base-sized DR to achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness in both supervised and zero-shot evaluations and even competes with models using more complex late interaction (ColBERTv2 and SPLADE++).","Title: Efficient Open Domain Multi-Hop Question Answering with Few-Shot Data Synthesis
Abstract: Few-shot learning for open domain multi-hop question answering typically relies on large language models (LLMs). While powerful, LLMs are inefficient at the inference time. We propose a data synthesis framework for multi-hop question answering that allows for improving smaller language models with less than 10 human-annotated question answer pairs. The framework is built upon the data generation functions parameterized by LLMs and prompts, which requires minimal hand-crafted features. Empirically, we synthesize millions of multi-hop questions and claims. After finetuning language models on the synthetic data, we evaluate the models on popular benchmarks on multi-hop question answering and fact verification. Our experimental results show that finetuning on the synthetic data improves model performance significantly, allowing our finetuned models to be competitive with prior models while being almost one-third the size in terms of parameter counts."
"Title: MedAlign: A Clinician-Generated Dataset for Instruction Following with Electronic Medical Records
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions with human-level fluency suggests many opportunities in healthcare to reduce administrative burden and improve quality of care. However, evaluating LLMs on realistic text generation tasks for healthcare remains challenging. Existing question answering datasets for electronic health record (EHR) data fail to capture the complexity of information needs and documentation burdens experienced by clinicians. To address these challenges, we introduce MedAlign, a benchmark dataset of 983 natural language instructions for EHR data. MedAlign is curated by 15 clinicians (7 specialities), includes clinician-written reference responses for 303 instructions, and provides 276 longitudinal EHRs for grounding instruction-response pairs. We used MedAlign to evaluate 6 general domain LLMs, having clinicians rank the accuracy and quality of each LLM response. We found high error rates, ranging from 35% (GPT-4) to 68% (MPT-7B-Instruct), and an 8.3% drop in accuracy moving from 32k to 2k context lengths for GPT-4. Finally, we report correlations between clinician rankings and automated natural language generation metrics as a way to rank LLMs without human review. We make MedAlign available under a research data use agreement to enable LLM evaluations on tasks aligned with clinician needs and preferences.","Title: Textbooks Are All You Need
Abstract: We introduce phi-1, a new large language model for code, with significantly smaller size than competing models: phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B parameters, trained for 4 days on 8 A100s, using a selection of ``textbook quality""data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically generated textbooks and exercises with GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent properties compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding exercises, and phi-1-small, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline as phi-1 that still achieves 45% on HumanEval."
"Title: Leveraging Domain Relations for Domain Generalization
Abstract: Distribution shift is a major challenge in machine learning, as models often perform poorly during the test stage if the test distribution differs from the training distribution. In this paper, we focus on domain shifts, which occur when the model is applied to new domains that are different from the ones it was trained on, and propose a new approach called D^3G. Unlike previous approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, D^3G learns domain-specific models by leveraging the relations among different domains. Concretely, D^3G learns a set of training-domain-specific functions during the training stage and reweights them based on domain relations during the test stage. These domain relations can be directly derived or learned from fixed domain meta-data. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically proved that using domain relations to reweight training-domain-specific functions achieves stronger generalization compared to averaging them. Empirically, we evaluated the effectiveness of D^3G using both toy and real-world datasets for tasks such as temperature regression, land use classification, and molecule-protein interaction prediction. Our results showed that D^3G consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 10.6% in performance.","Title: A Group Symmetric Stochastic Differential Equation Model for Molecule Multi-modal Pretraining
Abstract: Molecule pretraining has quickly become the go-to schema to boost the performance of AI-based drug discovery. Naturally, molecules can be represented as 2D topological graphs or 3D geometric point clouds. Although most existing pertaining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE. MoleculeSDE leverages group symmetric (e.g., SE(3)-equivariant and reflection-antisymmetric) stochastic differential equation models to generate the 3D geometries from 2D topologies, and vice versa, directly in the input space. It not only obtains tighter MI bound but also enables prosperous downstream tasks than the previous work. By comparing with 17 pretraining baselines, we empirically verify that MoleculeSDE can learn an expressive representation with state-of-the-art performance on 26 out of 32 downstream tasks."
"Title: Empowering Dynamics-aware Text-to-Video Diffusion with Large Language Models
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the community, in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation, they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets suggest that our framework consistently outperforms prior arts with significant margins, especially in the scenario with complex actions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for translating natural-language instructions into executable robot actions using OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a few-shot setting. We propose customizable input prompts for ChatGPT that can easily integrate with robot execution systems or visual recognition programs, adapt to various environments, and create multi-step task plans while mitigating the impact of token limit imposed on ChatGPT. In our approach, ChatGPT receives both instructions and textual environmental data, and outputs a task plan and an updated environment. These environmental data are reused in subsequent task planning, thus eliminating the extensive record-keeping of prior task plans within the prompts of ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of these prompts across various domestic environments, such as manipulations in front of a shelf, a fridge, and a drawer. The conversational capability of ChatGPT allows users to adjust the output via natural-language feedback. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation using VirtualHome showed that our results are comparable to previous studies. Specifically, 36% of task planning met both executability and correctness, and the rate approached 100% after several rounds of feedback. Our experiments revealed that ChatGPT can reasonably plan tasks and estimate post-operation environments without actual experience in object manipulation. Despite the allure of ChatGPT-based task planning in robotics, a standardized methodology remains elusive, making our work a substantial contribution. These prompts can serve as customizable templates, offering practical resources for the robotics research community. Our prompts and source code are open source and publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/ChatGPT-Robot-Manipulation-Prompts."
"Title: Language Conditioned Traffic Generation
Abstract: Simulation forms the backbone of modern self-driving development. Simulators help develop, test, and improve driving systems without putting humans, vehicles, or their environment at risk. However, simulators face a major challenge: They rely on realistic, scalable, yet interesting content. While recent advances in rendering and scene reconstruction make great strides in creating static scene assets, modeling their layout, dynamics, and behaviors remains challenging. In this work, we turn to language as a source of supervision for dynamic traffic scene generation. Our model, LCTGen, combines a large language model with a transformer-based decoder architecture that selects likely map locations from a dataset of maps, and produces an initial traffic distribution, as well as the dynamics of each vehicle. LCTGen outperforms prior work in both unconditional and conditional traffic scene generation in terms of realism and fidelity. Code and video will be available at https://ariostgx.github.io/lctgen.","Title: Can you text what is happening? Integrating pre-trained language encoders into trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving
Abstract: In autonomous driving tasks, scene understanding is the first step towards predicting the future behavior of the surrounding traffic participants. Yet, how to represent a given scene and extract its features are still open research questions. In this study, we propose a novel text-based representation of traffic scenes and process it with a pre-trained language encoder. First, we show that text-based representations, combined with classical rasterized image representations, lead to descriptive scene embeddings. Second, we benchmark our predictions on the nuScenes dataset and show significant improvements compared to baselines. Third, we show in an ablation study that a joint encoder of text and rasterized images outperforms the individual encoders confirming that both representations have their complementary strengths."
"Title: Zero-shot Learning with Minimum Instruction to Extract Social Determinants and Family History from Clinical Notes using GPT Model
Abstract: Demographics, Social determinants of health, and family history documented in the unstructured text within the electronic health records are increasingly being studied to understand how this information can be utilized with the structured data to improve healthcare outcomes. After the GPT models were released, many studies have applied GPT models to extract this information from the narrative clinical notes. Different from the existing work, our research focuses on investigating the zero-shot learning on extracting this information together by providing minimum information to the GPT model. We utilize de-identified real-world clinical notes annotated for demographics, various social determinants, and family history information. Given that the GPT model might provide text different from the text in the original data, we explore two sets of evaluation metrics, including the traditional NER evaluation metrics and semantic similarity evaluation metrics, to completely understand the performance. Our results show that the GPT-3.5 method achieved an average of 0.975 F1 on demographics extraction, 0.615 F1 on social determinants extraction, and 0.722 F1 on family history extraction. We believe these results can be further improved through model fine-tuning or few-shots learning. Through the case studies, we also identified the limitations of the GPT models, which need to be addressed in future research.","Title: Self-consistency for open-ended generations
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit considerable variation in the quality of their sampled outputs. Reranking and selecting the best generation from the sampled set is a popular way of obtaining strong gains in generation quality. In this paper, we present a novel approach for reranking LLM generations. Unlike other techniques that might involve additional inferences or training a specialized reranker, our approach relies on easy to compute pairwise statistics between the generations that have minimal compute overhead. We show that our approach can be formalized as an extension of self-consistency and analyze its performance in that framework, theoretically as well as via simulations. We show strong improvements for selecting the best $k$ generations for code generation tasks as well as robust improvements for best generation for the tasks of autoformalization, and summarization. While our approach only assumes black-box access to LLMs, we show that additional access to token probabilities can improve performance even further."
"Title: Prompt2Model: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable system builders today to create competent NLP systems through prompting, where they only need to describe the task in natural language and provide a few examples. However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment. Prompt2Model is available open-source at https://github.com/neulab/prompt2model.","Title: A Systematic Study of Knowledge Distillation for Natural Language Generation with Pseudo-Target Training
Abstract: Modern Natural Language Generation (NLG) models come with massive computational and storage requirements. In this work, we study the potential of compressing them, which is crucial for real-world applications serving millions of users. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques, in which a small student model learns to imitate a large teacher model, allowing to transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student. In contrast to much of the previous work, our goal is to optimize the model for a specific NLG task and a specific dataset. Typically in real-world applications, in addition to labeled data there is abundant unlabeled task-specific data, which is crucial for attaining high compression rates via KD. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of task-specific KD techniques for various NLG tasks under realistic assumptions. We discuss the special characteristics of NLG distillation and particularly the exposure bias problem. Following, we derive a family of Pseudo-Target (PT) augmentation methods, substantially extending prior work on sequence-level KD. We propose the Joint-Teaching method, which applies word-level KD to multiple PTs generated by both the teacher and the student.Finally, we validate our findings in an extreme setup with no labeled examples using GPT-4 as the teacher. Our study provides practical model design observations and demonstrates the effectiveness of PT training for task-specific KD in NLG."
"Title: Self-supervised learning of Split Invariant Equivariant representations
Abstract: Recent progress has been made towards learning invariant or equivariant representations with self-supervised learning. While invariant methods are evaluated on large scale datasets, equivariant ones are evaluated in smaller, more controlled, settings. We aim at bridging the gap between the two in order to learn more diverse representations that are suitable for a wide range of tasks. We start by introducing a dataset called 3DIEBench, consisting of renderings from 3D models over 55 classes and more than 2.5 million images where we have full control on the transformations applied to the objects. We further introduce a predictor architecture based on hypernetworks to learn equivariant representations with no possible collapse to invariance. We introduce SIE (Split Invariant-Equivariant) which combines the hypernetwork-based predictor with representations split in two parts, one invariant, the other equivariant, to learn richer representations. We demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance related tasks from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. We further analyze our introduced predictor and show how it steers the learned latent space. We hope that both our introduced dataset and approach will enable learning richer representations without supervision in more complex scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SIE.","Title: MC-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Self-Supervised Learning of Motion and Content Features
Abstract: Self-supervised learning of visual representations has been focusing on learning content features, which do not capture object motion or location, and focus on identifying and differentiating objects in images and videos. On the other hand, optical flow estimation is a task that does not involve understanding the content of the images on which it is estimated. We unify the two approaches and introduce MC-JEPA, a joint-embedding predictive architecture and self-supervised learning approach to jointly learn optical flow and content features within a shared encoder, demonstrating that the two associated objectives; the optical flow estimation objective and the self-supervised learning objective; benefit from each other and thus learn content features that incorporate motion information. The proposed approach achieves performance on-par with existing unsupervised optical flow benchmarks, as well as with common self-supervised learning approaches on downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation of images and videos."
"Title: Transferability of Convolutional Neural Networks in Stationary Learning Tasks
Abstract: Recent advances in hardware and big data acquisition have accelerated the development of deep learning techniques. For an extended period of time, increasing the model complexity has led to performance improvements for various tasks. However, this trend is becoming unsustainable and there is a need for alternative, computationally lighter methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for efficient training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for large-scale spatial problems. To accomplish this we investigate the properties of CNNs for tasks where the underlying signals are stationary. We show that a CNN trained on small windows of such signals achieves a nearly performance on much larger windows without retraining. This claim is supported by our theoretical analysis, which provides a bound on the performance degradation. Additionally, we conduct thorough experimental analysis on two tasks: multi-target tracking and mobile infrastructure on demand. Our results show that the CNN is able to tackle problems with many hundreds of agents after being trained with fewer than ten. Thus, CNN architectures provide solutions to these problems at previously computationally intractable scales.","Title: Solving Large-scale Spatial Problems with Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract: Over the past decade, deep learning research has been accelerated by increasingly powerful hardware, which facilitated rapid growth in the model complexity and the amount of data ingested. This is becoming unsustainable and therefore refocusing on efficiency is necessary. In this paper, we employ transfer learning to improve training efficiency for large-scale spatial problems. We propose that a convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained on small windows of signals, but evaluated on arbitrarily large signals with little to no performance degradation, and provide a theoretical bound on the resulting generalization error. Our proof leverages shift-equivariance of CNNs, a property that is underexploited in transfer learning. The theoretical results are experimentally supported in the context of mobile infrastructure on demand (MID). The proposed approach is able to tackle MID at large scales with hundreds of agents, which was computationally intractable prior to this work."
"Title: Towards an On-device Agent for Text Rewriting
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for text rewriting. Nonetheless, the large sizes of these models make them impractical for on-device inference, which would otherwise allow for enhanced privacy and economical inference. Creating a smaller yet potent language model for text rewriting presents a formidable challenge because it requires balancing the need for a small size with the need to retain the emergent capabilities of the LLM, that requires costly data collection. To address the above challenge, we introduce a new instruction tuning approach for building a mobile-centric text rewriting model. Our strategies enable the generation of high quality training data without any human labeling. In addition, we propose a heuristic reinforcement learning framework which substantially enhances performance without requiring preference data. To further bridge the performance gap with the larger server-side model, we propose an effective approach that combines the mobile rewrite agent with the server model using a cascade. To tailor the text rewriting tasks to mobile scenarios, we introduce MessageRewriteEval, a benchmark that focuses on text rewriting for messages through natural language instructions. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that our on-device model surpasses the current state-of-the-art LLMs in text rewriting while maintaining a significantly reduced model size. Notably, we show that our proposed cascading approach improves model performance.","Title: Speed Is All You Need: On-Device Acceleration of Large Diffusion Models via GPU-Aware Optimizations
Abstract: The rapid development and application of foundation models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Large diffusion models have gained significant attention for their ability to generate photorealistic images and support various tasks. On-device deployment of these models provides benefits such as lower server costs, offline functionality, and improved user privacy. However, common large diffusion models have over 1 billion parameters and pose challenges due to restricted computational and memory resources on devices. We present a series of implementation optimizations for large diffusion models that achieve the fastest reported inference latency to-date(under 12 seconds for Stable Diffusion 1.4 without INT8 quantization for a 512 × 512 image with 20 iterations) on GPU-equipped mobile devices. These enhancements broaden the applicability of generative AI and improve the overall user experience across a wide range of devices."
"Title: Do We Still Need Clinical Language Models?
Abstract: Although recent advances in scaling large language models (LLMs) have resulted in improvements on many NLP tasks, it remains unclear whether these models trained primarily with general web text are the right tool in highly specialized, safety critical domains such as clinical text. Recent results have suggested that LLMs encode a surprising amount of medical knowledge. This raises an important question regarding the utility of smaller domain-specific language models. With the success of general-domain LLMs, is there still a need for specialized clinical models? To investigate this question, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of 12 language models, ranging from 220M to 175B parameters, measuring their performance on 3 different clinical tasks that test their ability to parse and reason over electronic health records. As part of our experiments, we train T5-Base and T5-Large models from scratch on clinical notes from MIMIC III and IV to directly investigate the efficiency of clinical tokens. We show that relatively small specialized clinical models substantially outperform all in-context learning approaches, even when finetuned on limited annotated data. Further, we find that pretraining on clinical tokens allows for smaller, more parameter-efficient models that either match or outperform much larger language models trained on general text. We release the code and the models used under the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data license and data use agreement.","Title: PRISMA-DFLLM: An Extension of PRISMA for Systematic Literature Reviews using Domain-specific Finetuned Large Language Models
Abstract: With the proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and efficient finetuning techniques, we are on the cusp of the emergence of numerous domain-specific LLMs that have been finetuned for expertise across specialized fields and applications for which the current general-purpose LLMs are unsuitable. In academia, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs), access knowledge and generate new insights. This paper proposes an AI-enabled methodological framework that combines the power of LLMs with the rigorous reporting guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). By finetuning LLMs on domain-specific academic papers that have been selected as a result of a rigorous SLR process, the proposed PRISMA-DFLLM (for Domain-specific Finetuned LLMs) reporting guidelines offer the potential to achieve greater efficiency, reusability and scalability, while also opening the potential for conducting incremental living systematic reviews with the aid of LLMs. Additionally, the proposed approach for leveraging LLMs for SLRs enables the dissemination of finetuned models, empowering researchers to accelerate advancements and democratize cutting-edge research. This paper presents the case for the feasibility of finetuned LLMs to support rigorous SLRs and the technical requirements for realizing this. This work then proposes the extended PRISMA-DFLLM checklist of reporting guidelines as well as the advantages, challenges, and potential implications of implementing PRISMA-DFLLM. Finally, a future research roadmap to develop this line of AI-enabled SLRs is presented, paving the way for a new era of evidence synthesis and knowledge discovery."
"Title: Fairness in AI and Its Long-Term Implications on Society
Abstract: Successful deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in various settings has led to numerous positive outcomes for individuals and society. However, AI systems have also been shown to harm parts of the population due to biased predictions. AI fairness focuses on mitigating such biases to ensure AI decision making is not discriminatory towards certain groups. We take a closer look at AI fairness and analyze how lack of AI fairness can lead to deepening of biases over time and act as a social stressor. More specifically, we discuss how biased models can lead to more negative real-world outcomes for certain groups, which may then become more prevalent by deploying new AI models trained on increasingly biased data, resulting in a feedback loop. If the issues persist, they could be reinforced by interactions with other risks and have severe implications on society in the form of social unrest. We examine current strategies for improving AI fairness, assess their limitations in terms of real-world deployment, and explore potential paths forward to ensure we reap AI's benefits without causing society's collapse.","Title: Detecting Edit Failures In Large Language Models: An Improved Specificity Benchmark
Abstract: Recent model editing techniques promise to mitigate the problem of memorizing false or outdated associations during LLM training. However, we show that these techniques can introduce large unwanted side effects which are not detected by existing specificity benchmarks. We extend the existing CounterFact benchmark to include a dynamic component and dub our benchmark CounterFact+. Additionally, we extend the metrics used for measuring specificity by a principled KL divergence-based metric. We use this improved benchmark to evaluate recent model editing techniques and find that they suffer from low specificity. Our findings highlight the need for improved specificity benchmarks that identify and prevent unwanted side effects."
"Title: EVA-02: A Visual Representation for Neon Genesis
Abstract: We launch EVA-02, a next-generation Transformer-based visual representation pre-trained to reconstruct strong and robust language-aligned vision features via masked image modeling. With an updated plain Transformer architecture as well as extensive pre-training from an open&accessible giant CLIP vision encoder, EVA-02 demonstrates superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches across various representative vision tasks, while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and compute budgets. Notably, using exclusively publicly accessible training data, EVA-02 with only 304M parameters achieves a phenomenal 90.0 fine-tuning top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K val set. Additionally, our EVA-02-CLIP can reach up to 80.4 zero-shot top-1 on ImageNet-1K, outperforming the previous largest&best open-sourced CLIP with only ~1/6 parameters and ~1/6 image-text training data. We offer four EVA-02 variants in various model sizes, ranging from 6M to 304M parameters, all with impressive performance.

Abstract: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to improve performance, but they require significantly higher computation costs at inference time. To avoid these costs, multiple neural networks can be combined into one by averaging their weights. However, this usually performs significantly worse than ensembling. Weight averaging is only beneficial when different enough to benefit from combining them, but similar enough to average well. Based on this idea, we propose PopulAtion Parameter Averaging (PAPA): a method that combines the generality of ensembling with the efficiency of weight averaging. PAPA leverages a population of diverse models (trained on different data orders, augmentations, and regularizations) while slowly pushing the weights of the networks toward the population average of the weights. PAPA reduces the performance gap between averaging and ensembling, increasing the average accuracy of a population of models by up to 0.8% on CIFAR-10, 1.9% on CIFAR-100, and 1.6% on ImageNet when compared to training independent (non-averaged) models."
"Title: Efficient Attention via Control Variates
Abstract: Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.","Title: Coneheads: Hierarchy Aware Attention
Abstract: Attention networks such as transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains. These networks rely heavily on the dot product attention operator, which computes the similarity between two points by taking their inner product. However, the inner product does not explicitly model the complex structural properties of real world datasets, such as hierarchies between data points. To remedy this, we introduce cone attention, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones. Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones, which intuitively measures the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it improves task-level performance over dot product attention and other baselines, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters. Our results suggest that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention."
"Title: Editable Graph Neural Network for Node Classifications
Abstract: Despite Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved prominent success in many graph-based learning problem, such as credit risk assessment in financial networks and fake news detection in social networks. However, the trained GNNs still make errors and these errors may cause serious negative impact on society. \textit{Model editing}, which corrects the model behavior on wrongly predicted target samples while leaving model predictions unchanged on unrelated samples, has garnered significant interest in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. However, model editing for graph neural networks (GNNs) is rarely explored, despite GNNs' widespread applicability. To fill the gap, we first observe that existing model editing methods significantly deteriorate prediction accuracy (up to $50\%$ accuracy drop) in GNNs while a slight accuracy drop in multi-layer perception (MLP). The rationale behind this observation is that the node aggregation in GNNs will spread the editing effect throughout the whole graph. This propagation pushes the node representation far from its original one. Motivated by this observation, we propose \underline{E}ditable \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural \underline{N}etworks (EGNN), a neighbor propagation-free approach to correct the model prediction on misclassified nodes. Specifically, EGNN simply stitches an MLP to the underlying GNNs, where the weights of GNNs are frozen during model editing. In this way, EGNN disables the propagation during editing while still utilizing the neighbor propagation scheme for node prediction to obtain satisfactory results. Experiments demonstrate that EGNN outperforms existing baselines in terms of effectiveness (correcting wrong predictions with lower accuracy drop), generalizability (correcting wrong predictions for other similar nodes), and efficiency (low training time and memory) on various graph datasets.","Title: Graph Mixup with Soft Alignments
Abstract: We study graph data augmentation by mixup, which has been used successfully on images. A key operation of mixup is to compute a convex combination of a pair of inputs. This operation is straightforward for grid-like data, such as images, but challenging for graph data. The key difficulty lies in the fact that different graphs typically have different numbers of nodes, and thus there lacks a node-level correspondence between graphs. In this work, we propose S-Mixup, a simple yet effective mixup method for graph classification by soft alignments. Specifically, given a pair of graphs, we explicitly obtain node-level correspondence via computing a soft assignment matrix to match the nodes between two graphs. Based on the soft assignments, we transform the adjacency and node feature matrices of one graph, so that the transformed graph is aligned with the other graph. In this way, any pair of graphs can be mixed directly to generate an augmented graph. We conduct systematic experiments to show that S-Mixup can improve the performance and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on various graph classification tasks. In addition, we show that S-Mixup can increase the robustness of GNNs against noisy labels."
"Title: Video OWL-ViT: Temporally-consistent open-world localization in video
Abstract: We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pre-trained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.","Title: OVTrack: Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking
Abstract: The ability to recognize, localize and track dynamic objects in a scene is fundamental to many real-world applications, such as self-driving and robotic systems. Yet, traditional multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmarks rely only on a few object categories that hardly represent the multitude of possible objects that are encountered in the real world. This leaves contemporary MOT methods limited to a small set of pre-defined object categories. In this paper, we address this limitation by tackling a novel task, open-vocabulary MOT, that aims to evaluate tracking beyond pre-defined training categories. We further develop OVTrack, an open-vocabulary tracker that is capable of tracking arbitrary object classes. Its design is based on two key ingredients: First, leveraging vision-language models for both classification and association via knowledge distillation; second, a data hallucination strategy for robust appearance feature learning from denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is an extremely data-efficient open-vocabulary tracker that sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale, large-vocabulary TAO benchmark, while being trained solely on static images."
"Title: Optimizing ViViT Training: Time and Memory Reduction for Action Recognition
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges posed by the substantial training time and memory consumption associated with video transformers, focusing on the ViViT (Video Vision Transformer) model, in particular the Factorised Encoder version, as our baseline for action recognition tasks. The factorised encoder variant follows the late-fusion approach that is adopted by many state of the art approaches. Despite standing out for its favorable speed/accuracy tradeoffs among the different variants of ViViT, its considerable training time and memory requirements still pose a significant barrier to entry. Our method is designed to lower this barrier and is based on the idea of freezing the spatial transformer during training. This leads to a low accuracy model if naively done. But we show that by (1) appropriately initializing the temporal transformer (a module responsible for processing temporal information) (2) introducing a compact adapter model connecting frozen spatial representations ((a module that selectively focuses on regions of the input image) to the temporal transformer, we can enjoy the benefits of freezing the spatial transformer without sacrificing accuracy. Through extensive experimentation over 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed training strategy significantly reduces training costs (by $\sim 50\%$) and memory consumption while maintaining or slightly improving performance by up to 1.79\% compared to the baseline model. Our approach additionally unlocks the capability to utilize larger image transformer models as our spatial transformer and access more frames with the same memory consumption.","Title: Vid2Seq: Large-Scale Pretraining of a Visual Language Model for Dense Video Captioning
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Vid2Seq, a multi-modal single-stage dense event captioning model pretrained on narrated videos which are readily-available at scale. The Vid2Seq architecture augments a language model with special time tokens, allowing it to seamlessly predict event boundaries and textual descriptions in the same output sequence. Such a unified model requires large-scale training data, which is not available in current annotated datasets. We show that it is possible to leverage unlabeled narrated videos for dense video captioning, by reformulating sentence boundaries of transcribed speech as pseudo event boundaries, and using the transcribed speech sentences as pseudo event captions. The resulting Vid2Seq model pretrained on the YT-Temporal-1B dataset improves the state of the art on a variety of dense video captioning benchmarks including YouCook2, ViTT and ActivityNet Captions. Vid2Seq also generalizes well to the tasks of video paragraph captioning and video clip captioning, and to few-shot settings. Our code is publicly available at [1]."
"Title: Multifactor Sequential Disentanglement via Structured Koopman Autoencoders
Abstract: Disentangling complex data to its latent factors of variation is a fundamental task in representation learning. Existing work on sequential disentanglement mostly provides two factor representations, i.e., it separates the data to time-varying and time-invariant factors. In contrast, we consider multifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic disentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong inductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented linearly in the latent space. Under this assumption, it becomes natural to exploit the recently introduced Koopman autoencoder models. However, disentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus we propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman matrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor disentanglement. We showcase new disentangling abilities such as swapping of individual static factors between characters, and an incremental swap of disentangled factors from the source to the target. Moreover, we evaluate our method extensively on two factor standard benchmark tasks where we significantly improve over competing unsupervised approaches, and we perform competitively in comparison to weakly- and self-supervised state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/azencot-group/SKD.","Title: Sample and Predict Your Latent: Modality-free Sequential Disentanglement via Contrastive Estimation
Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement is a long-standing challenge in representation learning. Recently, self-supervised techniques achieved impressive results in the sequential setting, where data is time-dependent. However, the latter methods employ modality-based data augmentations and random sampling or solve auxiliary tasks. In this work, we propose to avoid that by generating, sampling, and comparing empirical distributions from the underlying variational model. Unlike existing work, we introduce a self-supervised sequential disentanglement framework based on contrastive estimation with no external signals, while using common batch sizes and samples from the latent space itself. In practice, we propose a unified, efficient, and easy-to-code sampling strategy for semantically similar and dissimilar views of the data. We evaluate our approach on video, audio, and time series benchmarks. Our method presents state-of-the-art results in comparison to existing techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/azencot-group/SPYL."
"Title: Calculating Originality of LLM Assisted Source Code
Abstract: The ease of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer a wide variety of queries and their high availability has resulted in LLMs getting integrated into various applications. LLM-based recommenders are now routinely used by students as well as professional software programmers for code generation and testing. Though LLM-based technology has proven useful, its unethical and unattributed use by students and professionals is a growing cause of concern. As such, there is a need for tools and technologies which may assist teachers and other evaluators in identifying whether any portion of a source code is LLM generated. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based tool that instructors can use to determine the original effort (and LLM's contribution) put by students in writing source codes. Our tool is motivated by minimum description length measures like Kolmogorov complexity. Our initial experiments with moderate sized (up to 500 lines of code) have shown promising results that we report in this paper.","Title: The No Free Lunch Theorem, Kolmogorov Complexity, and the Role of Inductive Biases in Machine Learning
Abstract: No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models."
"Title: Fairness of ChatGPT and the Role Of Explainable-Guided Prompts
Abstract: Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT, in credit risk assessment-a binary classification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when directed by judiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge, can parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Intriguingly, they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less, utilizing merely 20 data points compared to the ML's 800. LLMs particularly excel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness, both being vital aspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical ML models, they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks, laying a groundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse ML tasks.","Title: Large Language Models in the Workplace: A Case Study on Prompt Engineering for Job Type Classification
Abstract: This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate""reasoning""in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance."
"Title: Neural radiance fields in the industrial and robotics domain: applications, research opportunities and use cases
Abstract: The proliferation of technologies, such as extended reality (XR), has increased the demand for high-quality three-dimensional (3D) graphical representations. Industrial 3D applications encompass computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), scanning, and robotics. However, current methods employed for industrial 3D representations suffer from high implementation costs and reliance on manual human input for accurate 3D modeling. To address these challenges, neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning 3D scene representations based on provided training 2D images. Despite a growing interest in NeRFs, their potential applications in various industrial subdomains are still unexplored. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive examination of NeRF industrial applications while also providing direction for future research endeavors. We also present a series of proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate the potential of NeRFs in the industrial domain. These experiments include NeRF-based video compression techniques and using NeRFs for 3D motion estimation in the context of collision avoidance. In the video compression experiment, our results show compression savings up to 48\% and 74\% for resolutions of 1920x1080 and 300x168, respectively. The motion estimation experiment used a 3D animation of a robotic arm to train Dynamic-NeRF (D-NeRF) and achieved an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of disparity map with the value of 23 dB and an structural similarity index measure (SSIM) 0.97.","Title: NeRF in the Palm of Your Hand: Corrective Augmentation for Robotics via Novel-View Synthesis
Abstract: Expert demonstrations are a rich source of supervision for training visual robotic manipulation policies, but imitation learning methods often require either a large number of demonstrations or expensive online expert supervision to learn reactive closed-loop behaviors. In this work, we introduce SPARTN (Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF): a fully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use eye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to synthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs to generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the corrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or environment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a real-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping benchmark, SPARTN improves success rates by 2.8× over imitation learning without the corrective augmentations and even outperforms some methods that use online supervision. It additionally closes the gap between RGB-only and RGB-D success rates, eliminating the previous need for depth sensors. In real-world 6-DoF robotic grasping experiments from limited human demonstrations, our method improves absolute success rates by 22.5% on average, including objects that are traditionally challenging for depth-based methods.

"Title: Watermarking Conditional Text Generation for AI Detection: Unveiling Challenges and a Semantic-Aware Watermark Remedy
Abstract: To mitigate potential risks associated with language models, recent AI detection research proposes incorporating watermarks into machine-generated text through random vocabulary restrictions and utilizing this information for detection. While these watermarks only induce a slight deterioration in perplexity, our empirical investigation reveals a significant detriment to the performance of conditional text generation. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that considers the characteristics of conditional text generation and the input context. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method yields substantial improvements across various text generation models, including BART and Flan-T5, in tasks such as summarization and data-to-text generation while maintaining detection ability.","Title: ChatGPT is a Knowledgeable but Inexperienced Solver: An Investigation of Commonsense Problem in Large Language Models
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have made significant progress in NLP. However, their ability to memorize, represent, and leverage commonsense knowledge has been a well-known pain point for LLMs. It remains unclear that: (1) Can GPTs effectively answer commonsense questions? (2) Are GPTs knowledgeable in commonsense? (3) Are GPTs aware of the underlying commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question? (4) Can GPTs effectively leverage commonsense for answering questions? To evaluate the above commonsense problems, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate ChatGPT's commonsense abilities, and the experimental results show that: (1) GPTs can achieve good QA accuracy in commonsense tasks, while they still struggle with certain types of knowledge. (2) ChatGPT is knowledgeable, and can accurately generate most of the commonsense knowledge using knowledge prompts. (3) Despite its knowledge, ChatGPT is an inexperienced commonsense problem solver, which cannot precisely identify the needed commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question, i.e., ChatGPT does not precisely know what commonsense knowledge is required to answer a question. The above findings raise the need to investigate better mechanisms for utilizing commonsense knowledge in LLMs, such as instruction following, better commonsense guidance, etc."
"Title: Lawyer LLaMA Technical Report
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), like LLaMA, have exhibited remarkable performances across various tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed to specific domains such as law or medicine, the models still confront the challenge of a deficiency in domain-specific knowledge and an inadequate capability to leverage that knowledge to resolve domain-related problems. In this paper, we focus on the legal domain and explore how to inject domain knowledge during the continual training stage and how to design proper supervised finetune tasks to help the model tackle practical issues. Moreover, to alleviate the hallucination problem during model's generation, we add a retrieval module and extract relevant articles before the model answers any queries. Augmenting with the extracted evidence, our model could generate more reliable responses. We release our data and model at https://github.com/AndrewZhe/lawyer-llama.","Title: Can BERT Refrain from Forgetting on Sequential Tasks? A Probing Study
Abstract: Large pre-trained language models help to achieve state of the art on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, nevertheless, they still suffer from forgetting when incrementally learning a sequence of tasks. To alleviate this problem, recent works enhance existing models by sparse experience replay and local adaption, which yield satisfactory performance. However, in this paper we find that pre-trained language models like BERT have a potential ability to learn sequentially, even without any sparse memory replay. To verify the ability of BERT to maintain old knowledge, we adopt and re-finetune single-layer probe networks with the parameters of BERT fixed. We investigate the models on two types of NLP tasks, text classification and extractive question answering. Our experiments reveal that BERT can actually generate high quality representations for previously learned tasks in a long term, under extremely sparse replay or even no replay. We further introduce a series of novel methods to interpret the mechanism of forgetting and how memory rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges the gap between our new discovery and previous studies about catastrophic forgetting."
"Title: Ins-ATP: Deep Estimation of ATP for Organoid Based on High Throughput Microscopic Images
Abstract: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a high-energy phosphate compound and the most direct energy source in organisms. ATP is an essential biomarker for evaluating cell viability in biology. Researchers often use ATP bioluminescence to measure the ATP of organoid after drug to evaluate the drug efficacy. However, ATP bioluminescence has some limitations, leading to unreliable drug screening results. Performing ATP bioluminescence causes cell lysis of organoids, so it is impossible to observe organoids' long-term viability changes after medication continually. To overcome the disadvantages of ATP bioluminescence, we propose Ins-ATP, a non-invasive strategy, the first organoid ATP estimation model based on the high-throughput microscopic image. Ins-ATP directly estimates the ATP of organoids from high-throughput microscopic images, so that it does not influence the drug reactions of organoids. Therefore, the ATP change of organoids can be observed for a long time to obtain more stable results. Experimental results show that the ATP estimation by Ins-ATP is in good agreement with those determined by ATP bioluminescence. Specifically, the predictions of Ins-ATP are consistent with the results measured by ATP bioluminescence in the efficacy evaluation experiments of different drugs.","Title: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Patient-Derived Organoid Videos Using Deep Learning for the Prediction of Drug Efficacy
Abstract: Over the last ten years, Patient-Derived Organoids (PDOs) emerged as the most reliable technology to generate ex-vivo tumor avatars. PDOs retain the main characteristics of their original tumor, making them a system of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies. In particular, PDOs are attracting interest in the field of Functional Precision Medicine (FPM), which is based upon an ex-vivo drug test in which living tumor cells (such as PDOs) from a specific patient are exposed to a panel of anti-cancer drugs. Currently, the Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) based cell viability assay is the gold standard test to assess the sensitivity of PDOs to drugs. The readout is measured at the end of the assay from a global PDO population and therefore does not capture single PDO responses and does not provide time resolution of drug effect. To this end, in this study, we explore for the first time the use of powerful large foundation models for the automatic processing of PDO data. In particular, we propose a novel imaging-based high-throughput screening method to assess real-time drug efficacy from a time-lapse microscopy video of PDOs. The recently proposed SAM algorithm for segmentation and DINOv2 model are adapted in a comprehensive pipeline for processing PDO microscopy frames. Moreover, an attention mechanism is proposed for fusing temporal and spatial features in a multiple instance learning setting to predict ATP. We report better results than other non-time-resolved methods, indicating that the temporality of data is an important factor for the prediction of ATP. Extensive ablations shed light on optimizing the experimental setting and automating the prediction both in real-time and for forecasting."
"Title: Few-Shot Defect Image Generation via Defect-Aware Feature Manipulation
Abstract: The performances of defect inspection have been severely hindered by insufficient defect images in industries, which can be alleviated by generating more samples as data augmentation. We propose the first defect image generation method in the challenging few-shot cases. Given just a handful of defect images and relatively more defect-free ones, our goal is to augment the dataset with new defect images. Our method consists of two training stages. First, we train a data-efficient StyleGAN2 on defect-free images as the backbone. Second, we attach defect-aware residual blocks to the backbone, which learn to produce reasonable defect masks and accordingly manipulate the features within the masked regions by training the added modules on limited defect images. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD dataset not only validate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and diverse defect images, but also manifest the benefits it brings to downstream defect inspection tasks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Ldhlwh/DFMGAN.","Title: WeditGAN: Few-shot Image Generation via Latent Space Relocation
Abstract: In few-shot image generation, directly training GAN models on just a handful of images faces the risk of overfitting. A popular solution is to transfer the models pretrained on large source domains to small target ones. In this work, we introduce WeditGAN, which realizes model transfer by editing the intermediate latent codes $w$ in StyleGANs with learned constant offsets ($\Delta w$), discovering and constructing target latent spaces via simply relocating the distribution of source latent spaces. The established one-to-one mapping between latent spaces can naturally prevents mode collapse and overfitting. Besides, we also propose variants of WeditGAN to further enhance the relocation process by regularizing the direction or finetuning the intensity of $\Delta w$. Experiments on a collection of widely used source/target datasets manifest the capability of WeditGAN in generating realistic and diverse images, which is simple yet highly effective in the research area of few-shot image generation."
"Title: InpaintNeRF360: Text-Guided 3D Inpainting on Unbounded Neural Radiance Fields
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate highly realistic novel views. However, editing 3D scenes represented by NeRF across 360-degree views, particularly removing objects while preserving geometric and photometric consistency, remains a challenging problem due to NeRF's implicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose InpaintNeRF360, a unified framework that utilizes natural language instructions as guidance for inpainting NeRF-based 3D scenes.Our approach employs a promptable segmentation model by generating multi-modal prompts from the encoded text for multiview segmentation. We apply depth-space warping to enforce viewing consistency in the segmentations, and further refine the inpainted NeRF model using perceptual priors to ensure visual plausibility. InpaintNeRF360 is capable of simultaneously removing multiple objects or modifying object appearance based on text instructions while synthesizing 3D viewing-consistent and photo-realistic inpainting. Through extensive experiments on both unbounded and frontal-facing scenes trained through NeRF, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and showcase its potential to enhance the editability of implicit radiance fields.","Title: Industrial Segment Anything - a Case Study in Aircraft Manufacturing, Intralogistics, Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul
Abstract: Deploying deep learning-based applications in specialized domains like the aircraft production industry typically suffers from the training data availability problem. Only a few datasets represent non-everyday objects, situations, and tasks. Recent advantages in research around Vision Foundation Models (VFM) opened a new area of tasks and models with high generalization capabilities in non-semantic and semantic predictions. As recently demonstrated by the Segment Anything Project, exploiting VFM's zero-shot capabilities is a promising direction in tackling the boundaries spanned by data, context, and sensor variety. Although, investigating its application within specific domains is subject to ongoing research. This paper contributes here by surveying applications of the SAM in aircraft production-specific use cases. We include manufacturing, intralogistics, as well as maintenance, repair, and overhaul processes, also representing a variety of other neighboring industrial domains. Besides presenting the various use cases, we further discuss the injection of domain knowledge."
"Title: Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
Abstract: We present ControlNet, a neural network architecture to add spatial conditioning controls to large, pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. ControlNet locks the production-ready large diffusion models, and reuses their deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with billions of images as a strong backbone to learn a diverse set of conditional controls. The neural architecture is connected with""zero convolutions""(zero-initialized convolution layers) that progressively grow the parameters from zero and ensure that no harmful noise could affect the finetuning. We test various conditioning controls, eg, edges, depth, segmentation, human pose, etc, with Stable Diffusion, using single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts. We show that the training of ControlNets is robust with small (<50k) and large (>1m) datasets. Extensive results show that ControlNet may facilitate wider applications to control image diffusion models.","Title: Meta-DM: Applications of Diffusion Models on Few-Shot Learning
Abstract: In the field of few-shot learning (FSL), extensive research has focused on improving network structures and training strategies. However, the role of data processing modules has not been fully explored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Meta-DM, a generalized data processing module for FSL problems based on diffusion models. Meta-DM is a simple yet effective module that can be easily integrated with existing FSL methods, leading to significant performance improvements in both supervised and unsupervised settings. We provide a theoretical analysis of Meta-DM and evaluate its performance on several algorithms. Our experiments show that combining Meta-DM with certain methods achieves state-of-the-art results."
"Title: MVImgNet: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images
Abstract: Being data-driven is one of the most iconic properties of deep learning algorithms. The birth of ImageNet [24] drives a remarkable trend of ‘learning from large-scale data’ in computer vision. Pretraining on ImageNet to obtain rich universal representations has been manifested to benefit various 2D visual tasks, and becomes a standard in 2D vision. However, due to the laborious collection of real-world 3D data, there is yet no generic dataset serving as a counterpart of ImageNet in 3D vision, thus how such a dataset can impact the 3D community is unraveled. To remedy this defect, we introduce MVImgNet, a large-scale dataset of multi-view images, which is highly convenient to gain by shooting videos of real-world objects in human daily life. It contains 6.5 million frames from 219,188 videos crossing objects from 238 classes, with rich annotations of object masks, camera parameters, and point clouds. The multi-view attribute endows our dataset with 3D-aware signals, making it a soft bridge between 2D and 3D vision. We conduct pilot studies for probing the potential of MVImgNet on a variety of 3D and 2D visual tasks, including radiance field reconstruction, multi-view stereo, and view-consistent image understanding, where MVImgNet demonstrates promising performance, remaining lots of possibilities for future explorations. Besides, via dense reconstruction on MVImgNet, a 3D object point cloud dataset is derived, called MVPNet, covering 87,200 samples from 150 categories, with the class label on each point cloud. Experiments show that MVP-Net can benefit the real-world 3D object classification while posing new challenges to point cloud understanding. MVImgNet and MVPNet will be public, hoping to inspire the broader vision community.","Title: Tame a Wild Camera: In-the-Wild Monocular Camera Calibration
Abstract: 3D sensing for monocular in-the-wild images, e.g., depth estimation and 3D object detection, has become increasingly important. However, the unknown intrinsic parameter hinders their development and deployment. Previous methods for the monocular camera calibration rely on specific 3D objects or strong geometry prior, such as using a checkerboard or imposing a Manhattan World assumption. This work solves the problem from the other perspective by exploiting the monocular 3D prior. Our method is assumption-free and calibrates the complete $4$ Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) intrinsic parameters. First, we demonstrate intrinsic is solved from two well-studied monocular priors, i.e., monocular depthmap, and surface normal map. However, this solution imposes a low-bias and low-variance requirement for depth estimation. Alternatively, we introduce a novel monocular 3D prior, the incidence field, defined as the incidence rays between points in 3D space and pixels in the 2D imaging plane. The incidence field is a pixel-wise parametrization of the intrinsic invariant to image cropping and resizing. With the estimated incidence field, a robust RANSAC algorithm recovers intrinsic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing superior performance on synthetic and zero-shot testing datasets. Beyond calibration, we demonstrate downstream applications in image manipulation detection&restoration, uncalibrated two-view pose estimation, and 3D sensing.

"Title: Chameleon: Plug-and-Play Compositional Reasoning with Large Language Models
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in solving various natural language processing tasks due to emergent reasoning abilities. However, LLMs have inherent limitations as they are incapable of accessing up-to-date information (stored on the Web or in task-specific knowledge bases), using external tools, and performing precise mathematical and logical reasoning. In this paper, we present Chameleon, an AI system that mitigates these limitations by augmenting LLMs with plug-and-play modules for compositional reasoning. Chameleon synthesizes programs by composing various tools (e.g., LLMs, off-the-shelf vision models, web search engines, Python functions, and heuristic-based modules) for accomplishing complex reasoning tasks. At the heart of Chameleon is an LLM-based planner that assembles a sequence of tools to execute to generate the final response. We showcase the effectiveness of Chameleon on two multi-modal knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks: ScienceQA and TabMWP. Chameleon, powered by GPT-4, achieves an 86.54% overall accuracy on ScienceQA, improving the best published few-shot result by 11.37%. On TabMWP, GPT-4-powered Chameleon improves the accuracy by 17.0%, lifting the state of the art to 98.78%. Our analysis also shows that the GPT-4-powered planner exhibits more consistent and rational tool selection via inferring potential constraints from instructions, compared to a ChatGPT-powered planner.","Title: LLM-grounded Diffusion: Enhancing Prompt Understanding of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Large Language Models
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation with diffusion models have yielded remarkable results synthesizing highly realistic and diverse images. However, these models still encounter difficulties when generating images from prompts that demand spatial or common sense reasoning. We propose to equip diffusion models with enhanced reasoning capabilities by using off-the-shelf pretrained large language models (LLMs) in a novel two-stage generation process. First, we adapt an LLM to be a text-guided layout generator through in-context learning. When provided with an image prompt, an LLM outputs a scene layout in the form of bounding boxes along with corresponding individual descriptions. Second, we steer a diffusion model with a novel controller to generate images conditioned on the layout. Both stages utilize frozen pretrained models without any LLM or diffusion model parameter optimization. We validate the superiority of our design by demonstrating its ability to outperform the base diffusion model in accurately generating images according to prompts that necessitate both language and spatial reasoning. Additionally, our method naturally allows dialog-based scene specification and is able to handle prompts in a language that is not well-supported by the underlying diffusion model."
"Title: AWESOME: GPU Memory-constrained Long Document Summarization using Memory Mechanism and Global Salient Content
Abstract: Long document summarization systems are critical for domains with lengthy and jargonladen text, yet they present significant challenges to researchers and developers with limited computing resources. Existing solutions mainly focus on efficient attentions or divide-and-conquer strategies. The former reduces theoretical time complexity, but is still memory-heavy. The latter methods sacrifice global context, leading to uninformative and incoherent summaries. This work aims to leverage the memory-efficient nature of divide-and-conquer methods while preserving global context. Concretely, our framework AWESOME uses two novel mechanisms: (1) External memory mechanisms track previously encoded document segments and their corresponding summaries, to enhance global document understanding and summary coherence. (2) Global salient content is further identified beforehand to augment each document segment to support its summarization. Extensive experiments on diverse genres of text, including government reports, transcripts, scientific papers, and novels, show that AWESOME produces summaries with improved informativeness, faithfulness, and coherence than competitive baselines on longer documents, while having a similar or smaller GPU memory footprint.","Title: Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input
Abstract: Since the proposal of transformers, these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer ."
"Title: Reveal to Revise: An Explainable AI Life Cycle for Iterative Bias Correction of Deep Models
Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning models often learn spurious correlations embedded in the training data. This poses risks when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications like skin cancer detection. To tackle this problem, we propose Reveal to Revise (R2R), a framework entailing the entire eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) life cycle, enabling practitioners to iteratively identify, mitigate, and (re-)evaluate spurious model behavior with a minimal amount of human interaction. In the first step (1), R2R reveals model weaknesses by finding outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by the model. Secondly (2), the responsible artifacts are detected and spatially localized in the input data, which is then leveraged to (3) revise the model behavior. Concretely, we apply the methods of RRR, CDEP and ClArC for model correction, and (4) (re-)evaluate the model's performance and remaining sensitivity towards the artifact. Using two medical benchmark datasets for Melanoma detection and bone age estimation, we apply our R2R framework to VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet architectures and thereby reveal and correct real dataset-intrinsic artifacts, as well as synthetic variants in a controlled setting. Completing the XAI life cycle, we demonstrate multiple R2R iterations to mitigate different biases. Code is available on https://github.com/maxdreyer/Reveal2Revise.","Title: From Hope to Safety: Unlearning Biases of Deep Models by Enforcing the Right Reasons in Latent Space
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are prone to learning spurious correlations embedded in the training data, leading to potentially biased predictions. This poses risks when deploying these models for high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications. Current methods for post-hoc model correction either require input-level annotations, which are only possible for spatially localized biases, or augment the latent feature space, thereby hoping to enforce the right reasons. We present a novel method ensuring the right reasons on the concept level by reducing the model's sensitivity towards biases through the gradient. When modeling biases via Concept Activation Vectors, we highlight the importance of choosing robust directions, as traditional regression-based approaches such as Support Vector Machines tend to result in diverging directions. We effectively mitigate biases in controlled and real-world settings on the ISIC, Bone Age, ImageNet and CelebA datasets using VGG, ResNet and EfficientNet architectures."
"Title: VisualGPTScore: Visio-Linguistic Reasoning with Multimodal Generative Pre-Training Scores
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) discriminatively pre-trained with contrastive image-text matching losses such as $P(\text{match}|\text{text}, \text{image})$ have been criticized for lacking compositional understanding. This means they might output similar scores even if the original caption is rearranged into a different semantic statement. To address this, we propose to use the ${\bf V}$isual ${\bf G}$enerative ${\bf P}$re-${\bf T}$raining Score (${\bf VisualGPTScore}$) of $P(\text{text}|\text{image})$, a $\textit{multimodal generative}$ score that captures the likelihood of a text caption conditioned on an image using an image-conditioned language model. Contrary to the belief that VLMs are mere bag-of-words models, our off-the-shelf VisualGPTScore demonstrates top-tier performance on recently proposed image-text retrieval benchmarks like ARO and Crepe that assess compositional reasoning. Furthermore, we factorize VisualGPTScore into a product of the $\textit{marginal}$ P(text) and the $\textit{Pointwise Mutual Information}$ (PMI). This helps to (a) diagnose datasets with strong language bias, and (b) debias results on other benchmarks like Winoground using an information-theoretic framework. VisualGPTScore provides valuable insights and serves as a strong baseline for future evaluation of visio-linguistic compositionality.","Title: PUG: Photorealistic and Semantically Controllable Synthetic Data for Representation Learning
Abstract: Synthetic image datasets offer unmatched advantages for designing and evaluating deep neural networks: they make it possible to (i) render as many data samples as needed, (ii) precisely control each scene and yield granular ground truth labels (and captions), (iii) precisely control distribution shifts between training and testing to isolate variables of interest for sound experimentation. Despite such promise, the use of synthetic image data is still limited -- and often played down -- mainly due to their lack of realism. Most works therefore rely on datasets of real images, which have often been scraped from public images on the internet, and may have issues with regards to privacy, bias, and copyright, while offering little control over how objects precisely appear. In this work, we present a path to democratize the use of photorealistic synthetic data: we develop a new generation of interactive environments for representation learning research, that offer both controllability and realism. We use the Unreal Engine, a powerful game engine well known in the entertainment industry, to produce PUG (Photorealistic Unreal Graphics) environments and datasets for representation learning. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of PUG to enable more rigorous evaluations of vision models."
"Title: Visual Dependency Transformers: Dependency Tree Emerges from Reversed Attention
Abstract: Humans possess a versatile mechanism for extracting structured representations of our visual world. When looking at an image, we can decompose the scene into entities and their parts as well as obtain the dependencies between them. To mimic such capability, we propose Visual Dependency Transformers (DependencyViT) 11https://github.com/dingmyu/DependencyViT that can induce visual dependencies without any labels. We achieve that with a novel neural operator called reversed attention that can naturally capture long-range visual dependencies between image patches. Specifically, we formulate it as a dependency graph where a child token in reversed attention is trained to attend to its parent tokens and send information following a normalized probability distribution rather than gathering information in conventional self-attention. With such a design, hierarchies naturally emerge from reversed attention layers, and a dependency tree is progressively induced from leaf nodes to the root node unsupervisedly. DependencyViT offers several appealing benefits. (i) Entities and their parts in an image are represented by different subtrees, enabling part partitioning from dependencies; (ii) Dynamic visual pooling is made possible. The leaf nodes which rarely send messages can be pruned without hindering the model performance, based on which we propose the lightweight DependencyViT-Lite to reduce the computational and memory footprints; (iii) DependencyViT works well on both self- and weakly-supervised pretraining paradigms on ImageNet, and demonstrates its effectiveness on 8 datasets and 5 tasks, such as unsupervised part and saliency segmentation, recognition, and detection.","Title: Embodied Concept Learner: Self-supervised Learning of Concepts and Mapping through Instruction Following
Abstract: Humans, even at a very early age, can learn visual concepts and understand geometry and layout through active interaction with the environment, and generalize their compositions to complete tasks described by natural languages in novel scenes. To mimic such capability, we propose Embodied Concept Learner (ECL) in an interactive 3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground visual concepts, build semantic maps and plan actions to complete tasks by learning purely from human demonstrations and language instructions, without access to ground-truth semantic and depth supervisions from simulations. ECL consists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the natural languages into executable programs; (ii) an embodied concept learner that grounds visual concepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor that estimates depth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts; and (iv) a program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program. ECL has several appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it enables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting like babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive depth by disparities when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent and step-by-step interpretable in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be beneficial for the embodied instruction following (EIF), outperforming previous works on the ALFRED benchmark when the semantic label is not provided. Also, the learned concept can be reused for other downstream tasks, such as reasoning of object states. Project page: http://ecl.csail.mit.edu/"
"Title: Rejecting Cognitivism: Computational Phenomenology for Deep Learning
Abstract: We propose a non-representationalist framework for deep learning relying on a novel method: computational phenomenology, a dialogue between the first-person perspective (relying on phenomenology) and the mechanisms of computational models. We thereby reject the modern cognitivist interpretation of deep learning, according to which artificial neural networks encode representations of external entities. This interpretation mainly relies on neuro-representationalism, a position that combines a strong ontological commitment towards scientific theoretical entities and the idea that the brain operates on symbolic representations of these entities. We proceed as follows: after offering a review of cognitivism and neuro-representationalism in the field of deep learning, we first elaborate a phenomenological critique of these positions; we then sketch out computational phenomenology and distinguish it from existing alternatives; finally we apply this new method to deep learning models trained on specific tasks, in order to formulate a conceptual framework of deep-learning, that allows one to think of artificial neural networks' mechanisms in terms of lived experience.","Title: Designing explainable artificial intelligence with active inference: A framework for transparent introspection and decision-making
Abstract: This paper investigates the prospect of developing human-interpretable, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on active inference and the free energy principle. We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities."
"Title: GPT-4 Technical Report
Abstract: We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.","Title: MP3: Movement Primitive-Based (Re-)Planning Policy
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach called Movement Primitive-based Planning Policy (MP3). By integrating movement primitives (MPs) into the deep RL framework, MP3 enables the generation of smooth trajectories throughout the whole learning process while effectively learning from sparse and non-Markovian rewards. Additionally, MP3 maintains the capability to adapt to changes in the environment during execution. Although many early successes in robot RL have been achieved by combining RL with MPs, these approaches are often limited to learning single stroke-based motions, lacking the ability to adapt to task variations or adjust motions during execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced an episode-based RL method for the non-linear adaptation of MP parameters to different task variations, this paper extends the approach to incorporating replanning strategies. This allows adaptation of the MP parameters throughout motion execution, addressing the lack of online motion adaptation in stochastic domains requiring feedback. We compared our approach against state-of-the-art deep RL and RL with MPs methods. The results demonstrated improved performance in sophisticated, sparse reward settings and in domains requiring replanning."
"Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Methods, Applications, Visionary Prospects, and Challenges
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a widely used Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique. However, current studies and applications need to address its scalability, non-stationarity, and trustworthiness. This paper aims to review methods and applications and point out research trends and visionary prospects for the next decade. First, this paper summarizes the basic methods and application scenarios of MARL. Second, this paper outlines the corresponding research methods and their limitations on safety, robustness, generalization, and ethical constraints that need to be addressed in the practical applications of MARL. In particular, we believe that trustworthy MARL will become a hot research topic in the next decade. In addition, we suggest that considering human interaction is essential for the practical application of MARL in various societies. Therefore, this paper also analyzes the challenges while MARL is applied to human-machine interaction.","Title: Boundary-Aware Supervoxel-Level Iteratively Refined Interactive 3D Image Segmentation With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: Interactive segmentation has recently been explored to effectively and efficiently harvest high-quality segmentation masks by iteratively incorporating user hints. While iterative in nature, most existing interactive segmentation methods tend to ignore the dynamics of successive interactions and take each interaction independently. We here propose to model iterative interactive image segmentation with a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement learning (RL) where each voxel is treated as an agent. Considering the large exploration space for voxel-wise prediction and the dependence among neighboring voxels for the segmentation tasks, multi-agent reinforcement learning is adopted, where the voxel-level policy is shared among agents. Considering that boundary voxels are more important for segmentation, we further introduce a boundary-aware reward, which consists of a global reward in the form of relative cross-entropy gain, to update the policy in a constrained direction, and a boundary reward in the form of relative weight, to emphasize the correctness of boundary predictions. To combine the advantages of different types of interactions, i. e., simple and efficient for point-clicking, and stable and robust for scribbles, we propose a supervoxel-clicking based interaction design. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, with the advantage of fewer interactions, higher accuracy, and enhanced robustness."
"Title: Impossible Distillation: from Low-Quality Model to High-Quality Dataset & Model for Summarization and Paraphrasing
Abstract: It is commonly perceived that the strongest language models (LMs) rely on a combination of massive scale, instruction data, and human feedback to perform specialized tasks -- e.g. summarization and paraphrasing, without supervision. In this paper, we propose that language models can learn to summarize and paraphrase sentences, with none of these 3 factors. We present Impossible Distillation, a framework that distills a task-specific dataset directly from an off-the-shelf LM, even when it is impossible for the LM itself to reliably solve the task. By training a student model on the generated dataset and amplifying its capability through self-distillation, our method yields a high-quality model and dataset from a low-quality teacher model, without the need for scale or supervision. Using Impossible Distillation, we are able to distill an order of magnitude smaller model (with only 770M parameters) that outperforms 175B parameter GPT-3, in both quality and controllability, as confirmed by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, as a useful byproduct of our approach, we obtain DIMSUM+, a high-quality dataset with 3.4M sentence summaries and paraphrases. Our analyses show that this dataset, as a purely LM-generated corpus, is more diverse and more effective for generalization to unseen domains than all human-authored datasets -- including Gigaword with 4M samples.","Title: Large Language Models
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is making spectacular progress, and one of the best examples is the development of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT series. In these lectures, written for readers with a background in mathematics or physics, we give a brief history and survey of the state of the art, and describe the underlying transformer architecture in detail. We then explore some current ideas on how LLMs work and how models trained to predict the next word in a text are able to perform other tasks displaying intelligence."
"Title: Concept Learning for Interpretable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems are increasingly operating in real-world environments in close proximity to humans, yet are largely controlled by policy models with inscrutable deep neural network representations. We introduce a method for incorporating interpretable concepts from a domain expert into models trained through multi-agent reinforcement learning, by requiring the model to first predict such concepts then utilize them for decision making. This allows an expert to both reason about the resulting concept policy models in terms of these high-level concepts at run-time, as well as intervene and correct mispredictions to improve performance. We show that this yields improved interpretability and training stability, with benefits to policy performance and sample efficiency in a simulated and real-world cooperative-competitive multi-agent game.","Title: Sample-Efficient Learning of Novel Visual Concepts
Abstract: Despite the advances made in visual object recognition, state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to effectively recognize novel objects in a few-shot setting where only a limited number of examples are provided. Unlike humans who excel at such tasks, these models often fail to leverage known relationships between entities in order to draw conclusions about such objects. In this work, we show that incorporating a symbolic knowledge graph into a state-of-the-art recognition model enables a new approach for effective few-shot classification. In our proposed neuro-symbolic architecture and training methodology, the knowledge graph is augmented with additional relationships extracted from a small set of examples, improving its ability to recognize novel objects by considering the presence of interconnected entities. Unlike existing few-shot classifiers, we show that this enables our model to incorporate not only objects but also abstract concepts and affordances. The existence of the knowledge graph also makes this approach amenable to interpretability through analysis of the relationships contained within it. We empirically show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art few-shot multi-label classification methods on the COCO dataset and evaluate the addition of abstract concepts and affordances on the Visual Genome dataset."
"Title: Is the U.S. Legal System Ready for AI's Challenges to Human Values?
Abstract: Our interdisciplinary study investigates how effectively U.S. laws confront the challenges posed by Generative AI to human values. Through an analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios crafted during an expert workshop, we have identified notable gaps and uncertainties within the existing legal framework regarding the protection of fundamental values, such as privacy, autonomy, dignity, diversity, equity, and physical/mental well-being. Constitutional and civil rights, it appears, may not provide sufficient protection against AI-generated discriminatory outputs. Furthermore, even if we exclude the liability shield provided by Section 230, proving causation for defamation and product liability claims is a challenging endeavor due to the intricate and opaque nature of AI systems. To address the unique and unforeseeable threats posed by Generative AI, we advocate for legal frameworks that evolve to recognize new threats and provide proactive, auditable guidelines to industry stakeholders. Addressing these issues requires deep interdisciplinary collaborations to identify harms, values, and mitigation strategies.","Title: When Large Language Models Meet Personalization: Perspectives of Challenges and Opportunities
Abstract: The advent of large language models marks a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence. With the unprecedented scale of training and model parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language synthesizing, and common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap-forward in general AI capacity will change the pattern of how personalization is conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information filtering, large language models present the foundation for active user engagement. On top of such a new foundation, user requests can be proactively explored, and user's required information can be delivered in a natural and explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized services. By leveraging large language models as general-purpose interface, the personalization systems may compile user requests into plans, calls the functions of external tools to execute the plans, and integrate the tools' outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language models are still being developed, whereas the application in personalization is largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be the right time to review the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with LLMs. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for personalization."
"Title: Migrate Demographic Group For Fair GNNs
Abstract: Graph Neural networks (GNNs) have been applied in many scenarios due to the superior performance of graph learning. However, fairness is always ignored when designing GNNs. As a consequence, biased information in training data can easily affect vanilla GNNs, causing biased results toward particular demographic groups (divided by sensitive attributes, such as race and age). There have been efforts to address the fairness issue. However, existing fair techniques generally divide the demographic groups by raw sensitive attributes and assume that are fixed. The biased information correlated with raw sensitive attributes will run through the training process regardless of the implemented fair techniques. It is urgent to resolve this problem for training fair GNNs. To tackle this problem, we propose a brand new framework, FairMigration, which can dynamically migrate the demographic groups instead of keeping that fixed with raw sensitive attributes. FairMigration is composed of two training stages. In the first stage, the GNNs are initially optimized by personalized self-supervised learning, and the demographic groups are adjusted dynamically. In the second stage, the new demographic groups are frozen and supervised learning is carried out under the constraints of new demographic groups and adversarial training. Extensive experiments reveal that FairMigration balances model performance and fairness well.","Title: Toward Fairness in Text Generation via Mutual Information Minimization based on Importance Sampling
Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs), such as GPT2, have achieved remarkable empirical performance in text generation tasks. However, pretrained on large-scale natural language corpora, the generated text from PLMs may exhibit social bias against disadvantaged demographic groups. To improve the fairness of PLMs in text generation, we propose to minimize the mutual information between the semantics in the generated text sentences and their demographic polarity, i.e., the demographic group to which the sentence is referring. In this way, the mentioning of a demographic group (e.g., male or female) is encouraged to be independent from how it is described in the generated text, thus effectively alleviating the social bias. Moreover, we propose to efficiently estimate the upper bound of the above mutual information via importance sampling, leveraging a natural language corpus. We also propose a distillation mechanism that preserves the language modeling ability of the PLMs after debiasing. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior performance in term of both fairness and language modeling ability."
"Title: Merging Decision Transformers: Weight Averaging for Forming Multi-Task Policies
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of creating generalist, transformer-based, models for language, vision, and sequential decision-making problems. To create such models, we generally require centralized training objectives, data, and compute. It is of interest if we can more flexibly create generalist policies by merging together multiple, task-specific, individually trained policies. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction through merging, or averaging, subsets of Decision Transformers in parameter space trained on different MuJoCo locomotion problems, forming multi-task models without centralized training. We also show that when merging policies, we can obtain better results if all policies start from common, pre-trained initializations. We also find improvements from larger pre-trained models, and utilizing Fisher information for merging. In general, we believe research in this direction could help democratize and distribute the process of which forms generally capable models.","Title: Learning Universal Policies via Text-Guided Video Generation
Abstract: A goal of artificial intelligence is to construct an agent that can solve a wide variety of tasks. Recent progress in text-guided image synthesis has yielded models with an impressive ability to generate complex novel images, exhibiting combinatorial generalization across domains. Motivated by this success, we investigate whether such tools can be used to construct more general-purpose agents. Specifically, we cast the sequential decision making problem as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where, given a text-encoded specification of a desired goal, a planner synthesizes a set of future frames depicting its planned actions in the future, after which control actions are extracted from the generated video. By leveraging text as the underlying goal specification, we are able to naturally and combinatorially generalize to novel goals. The proposed policy-as-video formulation can further represent environments with different state and action spaces in a unified space of images, which, for example, enables learning and generalization across a variety of robot manipulation tasks. Finally, by leveraging pretrained language embeddings and widely available videos from the internet, the approach enables knowledge transfer through predicting highly realistic video plans for real robots."
"Title: LODE: Locally Conditioned Eikonal Implicit Scene Completion from Sparse LiDAR
Abstract: Scene completion refers to obtaining dense scene representation from an incomplete perception of complex 3D scenes. This helps robots detect multi-scale obstacles and analyse object occlusions in scenarios such as autonomous driving. Recent advances show that implicit representation learning can be leveraged for continuous scene completion and achieved through physical constraints like Eikonal equations. However, former Eikonal completion methods only demonstrate results on watertight meshes at a scale of tens of meshes. None of them are successfully done for non-watertight LiDAR point clouds of open large scenes at a scale of thousands of scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Eikonal formulation that conditions the implicit representation on localized shape priors which function as dense boundary value constraints, and demonstrate it works on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. It can also be extended to semantic Eikonal scene completion with only small modifications to the network architecture. With extensive quantitative and qualitative results, we demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks of existing Eikonal methods, which naturally leads to the new locally conditioned formulation. Notably, we improve IoU from 31.7% to 51.2% on SemanticKITTI and from 40.5% to 48.7% on SemanticPOSS. We extensively ablate our methods and demonstrate that the proposed formulation is robust to a wide spectrum of implementation hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Nowadays, autonomous cars can drive smoothly in ordinary cases, and it is widely recognized that realistic sensor simulation will play a critical role in solving remaining corner cases by simulating them. To this end, we propose an autonomous driving simulator based upon neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Compared with existing works, ours has three notable features: (1) Instance-aware. Our simulator models the foreground instances and background environments separately with independent networks so that the static (e.g., size and appearance) and dynamic (e.g., trajectory) properties of instances can be controlled separately. (2) Modular. Our simulator allows flexible switching between different modern NeRF-related backbones, sampling strategies, input modalities, etc. We expect this modular design to boost academic progress and industrial deployment of NeRF-based autonomous driving simulation. (3) Realistic. Our simulator set new state-of-the-art photo-realism results given the best module selection. Our simulator will be open-sourced while most of our counterparts are not.

"Title: Fairness of ChatGPT and the Role Of Explainable-Guided Prompts
Abstract: Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT, in credit risk assessment-a binary classification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when directed by judiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge, can parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Intriguingly, they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less, utilizing merely 20 data points compared to the ML's 800. LLMs particularly excel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness, both being vital aspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical ML models, they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks, laying a groundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse ML tasks.","Title: Fairness for All: Investigating Harms to Within-Group Individuals in Producer Fairness Re-ranking Optimization -- A Reproducibility Study
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used to provide personalized recommendations to users. Recent research has shown that recommender systems may be subject to different types of biases, such as popularity bias, leading to an uneven distribution of recommendation exposure among producer groups. To mitigate this, producer-centered fairness re-ranking (PFR) approaches have been proposed to ensure equitable recommendation utility across groups. However, these approaches overlook the harm they may cause to within-group individuals associated with colder items, which are items with few or no interactions. This study reproduces previous PFR approaches and shows that they significantly harm colder items, leading to a fairness gap for these items in both advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Surprisingly, the unfair base recommendation models were providing greater exposure opportunities to these individual cold items, even though at the group level, they appeared to be unfair. To address this issue, the study proposes an amendment to the PFR approach that regulates the number of colder items recommended by the system. This modification achieves a balance between accuracy and producer fairness while optimizing the selection of colder items within each group, thereby preventing or reducing harm to within-group individuals and augmenting the novelty of all recommended items. The proposed method is able to register an increase in sub-group fairness (SGF) from 0.3104 to 0.3782, 0.6156, and 0.9442 while also improving group-level fairness (GF) (112% and 37% with respect to base models and traditional PFR). Moreover, the proposed method achieves these improvements with minimal or no reduction in accuracy (or even an increase sometimes). We evaluate the proposed method on various recommendation datasets and demonstrate promising results independent of the underlying model or datasets."
"Title: TMI! Finetuned Models Leak Private Information from their Pretraining Data
Abstract: Transfer learning has become an increasingly popular technique in machine learning as a way to leverage a pretrained model trained for one task to assist with building a finetuned model for a related task. This paradigm has been especially popular for privacy in machine learning, where the pretrained model is considered public, and only the data for finetuning is considered sensitive. However, there are reasons to believe that the data used for pretraining is still sensitive, making it essential to understand how much information the finetuned model leaks about the pretraining data. In this work we propose a new membership-inference threat model where the adversary only has access to the finetuned model and would like to infer the membership of the pretraining data. To realize this threat model, we implement a novel metaclassifier-based attack, TMI, that leverages the influence of memorized pretraining samples on predictions in the downstream task. We evaluate TMI on both vision and natural language tasks across multiple transfer learning settings, including finetuning with differential privacy. Through our evaluation, we find that TMI can successfully infer membership of pretraining examples using query access to the finetuned model.","Title: Students Parrot Their Teachers: Membership Inference on Model Distillation
Abstract: Model distillation is frequently proposed as a technique to reduce the privacy leakage of machine learning. These empirical privacy defenses rely on the intuition that distilled ``student'' models protect the privacy of training data, as they only interact with this data indirectly through a ``teacher'' model. In this work, we design membership inference attacks to systematically study the privacy provided by knowledge distillation to both the teacher and student training sets. Our new attacks show that distillation alone provides only limited privacy across a number of domains. We explain the success of our attacks on distillation by showing that membership inference attacks on a private dataset can succeed even if the target model is *never* queried on any actual training points, but only on inputs whose predictions are highly influenced by training data. Finally, we show that our attacks are strongest when student and teacher sets are similar, or when the attacker can poison the teacher set."
"Title: Automatically Correcting Large Language Models: Surveying the landscape of diverse self-correction strategies
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide array of NLP tasks. However, their efficacy is undermined by undesired and inconsistent behaviors, including hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxic content. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is self-correction, where the LLM itself is prompted or guided to fix problems in its own output. Techniques leveraging automated feedback -- either produced by the LLM itself or some external system -- are of particular interest as they are a promising way to make LLM-based solutions more practical and deployable with minimal human feedback. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this emerging class of techniques. We analyze and taxonomize a wide array of recent work utilizing these strategies, including training-time, generation-time, and post-hoc correction. We also summarize the major applications of this strategy and conclude by discussing future directions and challenges.","Title: A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning: Theory, Method and Application
Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent agent needs to incrementally acquire, update, accumulate, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance degradation of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy, extensively analyzing how representative strategies address continual learning, and how they are adapted to particular challenges in various applications. Through an in-depth discussion of promising directions, we believe that such a holistic perspective can greatly facilitate subsequent exploration in this field and beyond."
"Title: Towards In-context Scene Understanding
Abstract: In-context learning$\unicode{x2013}$the ability to configure a model's behavior with different prompts$\unicode{x2013}$has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, alleviating the need for task-specific models and paving the way for generalist models capable of assisting with any query. Computer vision, in contrast, has largely stayed in the former regime: specialized decoders and finetuning protocols are generally required to perform dense tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this work we explore a simple mechanism for in-context learning of such scene understanding tasks: nearest neighbor retrieval from a prompt of annotated features. We propose a new pretraining protocol$\unicode{x2013}$leveraging attention within and across images$\unicode{x2013}$which yields representations particularly useful in this regime. The resulting Hummingbird model, suitably prompted, performs various scene understanding tasks without modification while approaching the performance of specialists that have been finetuned for each task. Moreover, Hummingbird can be configured to perform new tasks much more efficiently than finetuned models, raising the possibility of scene understanding in the interactive assistant regime.","Title: Time Does Tell: Self-Supervised Time-Tuning of Dense Image Representations
Abstract: Spatially dense self-supervised learning is a rapidly growing problem domain with promising applications for unsupervised segmentation and pretraining for dense downstream tasks. Despite the abundance of temporal data in the form of videos, this information-rich source has been largely overlooked. Our paper aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach that incorporates temporal consistency in dense self-supervised learning. While methods designed solely for images face difficulties in achieving even the same performance on videos, our method improves not only the representation quality for videos-but also images. Our approach, which we call time-tuning, starts from image-pretrained models and fine-tunes them with a novel self-supervised temporal-alignment clustering loss on unlabeled videos. This effectively facilitates the transfer of high-level information from videos to image representations. Time-tuning improves the state-of-the-art by 8-10% for unsupervised semantic segmentation on videos and matches it for images. We believe this method paves the way for further self-supervised scaling by leveraging the abundant availability of videos. The implementation can be found here : https://github.com/SMSD75/Timetuning"
"Title: A Survey of Hallucination in Large Foundation Models
Abstract: Hallucination in a foundation model (FM) refers to the generation of content that strays from factual reality or includes fabricated information. This survey paper provides an extensive overview of recent efforts that aim to identify, elucidate, and tackle the problem of hallucination, with a particular focus on ``Large'' Foundation Models (LFMs). The paper classifies various types of hallucination phenomena that are specific to LFMs and establishes evaluation criteria for assessing the extent of hallucination. It also examines existing strategies for mitigating hallucination in LFMs and discusses potential directions for future research in this area. Essentially, the paper offers a comprehensive examination of the challenges and solutions related to hallucination in LFMs.","Title: Deficiency-Aware Masked Transformer for Video Inpainting
Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods have made remarkable progress by utilizing explicit guidance, such as optical flow, to propagate cross-frame pixels. However, there are cases where cross-frame recurrence of the masked video is not available, resulting in a deficiency. In such situation, instead of borrowing pixels from other frames, the focus of the model shifts towards addressing the inverse problem. In this paper, we introduce a dual-modality-compatible inpainting framework called Deficiency-aware Masked Transformer (DMT), which offers three key advantages. Firstly, we pretrain a image inpainting model DMT_img serve as a prior for distilling the video model DMT_vid, thereby benefiting the hallucination of deficiency cases. Secondly, the self-attention module selectively incorporates spatiotemporal tokens to accelerate inference and remove noise signals. Thirdly, a simple yet effective Receptive Field Contextualizer is integrated into DMT, further improving performance. Extensive experiments conducted on YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets demonstrate that DMT_vid significantly outperforms previous solutions. The code and video demonstrations can be found at github.com/yeates/DMT."
"Title: Speed Is All You Need: On-Device Acceleration of Large Diffusion Models via GPU-Aware Optimizations
Abstract: The rapid development and application of foundation models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Large diffusion models have gained significant attention for their ability to generate photorealistic images and support various tasks. On-device deployment of these models provides benefits such as lower server costs, offline functionality, and improved user privacy. However, common large diffusion models have over 1 billion parameters and pose challenges due to restricted computational and memory resources on devices. We present a series of implementation optimizations for large diffusion models that achieve the fastest reported inference latency to-date(under 12 seconds for Stable Diffusion 1.4 without INT8 quantization for a 512 × 512 image with 20 iterations) on GPU-equipped mobile devices. These enhancements broaden the applicability of generative AI and improve the overall user experience across a wide range of devices.","Title: Softmax Bias Correction for Quantized Generative Models
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is the go-to compression technique for large generative models, such as stable diffusion or large language models. PTQ methods commonly keep the softmax activation in higher precision as it has been shown to be very sensitive to quantization noise. However, this can lead to a significant runtime and power overhead during inference on resource-constraint edge devices. In this work, we investigate the source of the softmax sensitivity to quantization and show that the quantization operation leads to a large bias in the softmax output, causing accuracy degradation. To overcome this issue, we propose an offline bias correction technique that improves the quantizability of softmax without additional compute during deployment, as it can be readily absorbed into the quantization parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on stable diffusion v1.5 and 125M-size OPT language model, achieving significant accuracy improvement for 8-bit quantized softmax."
"Title: Function-Consistent Feature Distillation
Abstract: Feature distillation makes the student mimic the intermediate features of the teacher. Nearly all existing feature-distillation methods use L2 distance or its slight variants as the distance metric between teacher and student features. However, while L2 distance is isotropic w.r.t. all dimensions, the neural network's operation on different dimensions is usually anisotropic, i.e., perturbations with the same 2-norm but in different dimensions of intermediate features lead to changes in the final output with largely different magnitude. Considering this, we argue that the similarity between teacher and student features should not be measured merely based on their appearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by their difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read, decode, and process them. Therefore, we propose Function-Consistent Feature Distillation (FCFD), which explicitly optimizes the functional similarity between teacher and student features. The core idea of FCFD is to make teacher and student features not only numerically similar, but more importantly produce similar outputs when fed to the later part of the same network. With FCFD, the student mimics the teacher more faithfully and learns more from the teacher. Extensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the superiority of FCFD to existing methods. Furthermore, we can combine FCFD with many existing methods to obtain even higher accuracy. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LiuDongyang6/FCFD.","Title: VanillaKD: Revisit the Power of Vanilla Knowledge Distillation from Small Scale to Large Scale
Abstract: The tremendous success of large models trained on extensive datasets demonstrates that scale is a key ingredient in achieving superior results. Therefore, the reflection on the rationality of designing knowledge distillation (KD) approaches for limited-capacity architectures solely based on small-scale datasets is now deemed imperative. In this paper, we identify the \emph{small data pitfall} that presents in previous KD methods, which results in the underestimation of the power of vanilla KD framework on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Specifically, we show that employing stronger data augmentation techniques and using larger datasets can directly decrease the gap between vanilla KD and other meticulously designed KD variants. This highlights the necessity of designing and evaluating KD approaches in the context of practical scenarios, casting off the limitations of small-scale datasets. Our investigation of the vanilla KD and its variants in more complex schemes, including stronger training strategies and different model capacities, demonstrates that vanilla KD is elegantly simple but astonishingly effective in large-scale scenarios. Without bells and whistles, we obtain state-of-the-art ResNet-50, ViT-S, and ConvNeXtV2-T models for ImageNet, which achieve 83.1\%, 84.3\%, and 85.0\% top-1 accuracy, respectively. PyTorch code and checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/Hao840/vanillaKD."
"Title: Evidence of Human-Like Visual-Linguistic Integration in Multimodal Large Language Models During Predictive Language Processing
Abstract: The advanced language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) have stimulated debate over their capacity to replicate human-like cognitive processes. One differentiating factor between language processing in LLMs and humans is that language input is often grounded in several perceptual modalities, whereas most LLMs process solely text-based information. Multimodal grounding allows humans to integrate - e.g. visual context with linguistic information and thereby place constraints on the space of upcoming words, reducing cognitive load and improving comprehension. Recent multimodal LLMs (mLLMs) combine a visual-linguistic embedding space with a transformer type attention mechanism for next-word prediction. Here we ask whether predictive language processing based on multimodal input in mLLMs aligns with humans. Two-hundred participants watched short audio-visual clips and estimated predictability of an upcoming verb or noun. The same clips were processed by the mLLM CLIP, with predictability scores based on comparing image and text feature vectors. Eye-tracking was used to estimate what visual features participants attended to, and CLIP's visual attention weights were recorded. We find that alignment of predictability scores was driven by multimodality of CLIP (no alignment for a unimodal state-of-the-art LLM) and by the attention mechanism (no alignment when attention weights were perturbated or when the same input was fed to a multimodal model without attention). We further find a significant spatial overlap between CLIP's visual attention weights and human eye-tracking data. Results suggest that comparable processes of integrating multimodal information, guided by attention to relevant visual features, supports predictive language processing in mLLMs and humans.","Title: BrainCLIP: Bridging Brain and Visual-Linguistic Representation via CLIP for Generic Natural Visual Stimulus Decoding from fMRI
Abstract: Due to the lack of paired samples and the low signal-to-noise ratio of functional MRI (fMRI) signals, reconstructing perceived natural images or decoding their semantic contents from fMRI data are challenging tasks. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a task-agnostic fMRI-based brain decoding model, BrainCLIP, which leverages CLIP's cross-modal generalization ability to bridge the modality gap between brain activity, image, and text. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP can act as a pivot for generic brain decoding tasks, including zero-shot visual categories decoding, fMRI-image/text matching, and fMRI-to-image generation. Specifically, BrainCLIP aims to train a mapping network that transforms fMRI patterns into a well-aligned CLIP embedding space by combining visual and textual supervision. Our experiments show that this combination can boost the decoding model's performance on certain tasks like fMRI-text matching and fMRI-to-image generation. On the zero-shot visual category decoding task, BrainCLIP achieves significantly better performance than BraVL, a recently proposed multi-modal method specifically designed for this task. BrainCLIP can also reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic fidelity and establishes a new state-of-the-art for fMRI-based natural image reconstruction in terms of high-level semantic features."
"Title: Subjective Crowd Disagreements for Subjective Data: Uncovering Meaningful CrowdOpinion with Population-level Learning
Abstract: Human-annotated data plays a critical role in the fairness of AI systems, including those that deal with life-altering decisions or moderating human-created web/social media content. Conventionally, annotator disagreements are resolved before any learning takes place. However, researchers are increasingly identifying annotator disagreement as pervasive and meaningful. They also question the performance of a system when annotators disagree. Particularly when minority views are disregarded, especially among groups that may already be underrepresented in the annotator population. In this paper, we introduce CrowdOpinion, an unsupervised learning based approach that uses language features and label distributions to pool similar items into larger samples of label distributions. We experiment with four generative and one density-based clustering method, applied to five linear combinations of label distributions and features. We use five publicly available benchmark datasets (with varying levels of annotator disagreements) from social media (Twitter, Gab, and Reddit). We also experiment in the wild using a dataset from Facebook, where annotations come from the platform itself by users reacting to posts. We evaluate CrowdOpinion as a label distribution prediction task using KL-divergence and a single-label problem using accuracy measures.","Title: Second Thoughts are Best: Learning to Re-Align With Human Values from Text Edits
Abstract: We present Second Thought, a new learning paradigm that enables language models (LMs) to re-align with human values. By modeling the chain-of-edits between value-unaligned and value-aligned text, with LM fine-tuning and additional refinement through reinforcement learning, Second Thought not only achieves superior performance in three value alignment benchmark datasets but also shows strong human-value transfer learning ability in few-shot scenarios. The generated editing steps also offer better interpretability and ease for interactive error correction. Extensive human evaluations further confirm its effectiveness."
"Title: Multimodal Inverse Cloze Task for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering
Abstract: We present a new pre-training method, Multimodal Inverse Cloze Task, for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about named Entities (KVQAE). KVQAE is a recently introduced task that consists in answering questions about named entities grounded in a visual context using a Knowledge Base. Therefore, the interaction between the modalities is paramount to retrieve information and must be captured with complex fusion models. As these models require a lot of training data, we design this pre-training task from existing work in textual Question Answering. It consists in considering a sentence as a pseudo-question and its context as a pseudo-relevant passage and is extended by considering images near texts in multimodal documents. Our method is applicable to different neural network architectures and leads to a 9% relative-MRR and 15% relative-F1 gain for retrieval and reading comprehension, respectively, over a no-pre-training baseline.","Title: The Contribution of Knowledge in Visiolinguistic Learning: A Survey on Tasks and Challenges
Abstract: Recent advancements in visiolinguistic (VL) learning have allowed the development of multiple models and techniques that offer several impressive implementations, able to currently resolve a variety of tasks that require the collaboration of vision and language. Current datasets used for VL pre-training only contain a limited amount of visual and linguistic knowledge, thus significantly limiting the generalization capabilities of many VL models. External knowledge sources such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to cover such generalization gaps by filling in missing knowledge, resulting in the emergence of hybrid architectures. In the current survey, we analyze tasks that have benefited from such hybrid approaches. Moreover, we categorize existing knowledge sources and types, proceeding to discussion regarding the KG vs LLM dilemma and its potential impact to future hybrid approaches."
"Title: Industrial Segment Anything - a Case Study in Aircraft Manufacturing, Intralogistics, Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul
Abstract: Deploying deep learning-based applications in specialized domains like the aircraft production industry typically suffers from the training data availability problem. Only a few datasets represent non-everyday objects, situations, and tasks. Recent advantages in research around Vision Foundation Models (VFM) opened a new area of tasks and models with high generalization capabilities in non-semantic and semantic predictions. As recently demonstrated by the Segment Anything Project, exploiting VFM's zero-shot capabilities is a promising direction in tackling the boundaries spanned by data, context, and sensor variety. Although, investigating its application within specific domains is subject to ongoing research. This paper contributes here by surveying applications of the SAM in aircraft production-specific use cases. We include manufacturing, intralogistics, as well as maintenance, repair, and overhaul processes, also representing a variety of other neighboring industrial domains. Besides presenting the various use cases, we further discuss the injection of domain knowledge.","Title: Literature Review: Computer Vision Applications in Transportation Logistics and Warehousing
Abstract: Computer vision applications in transportation logistics and warehousing have a huge potential for process automation. We present a structured literature review on research in the field to help leverage this potential. The literature is categorized w.r.t. the application, i.e. the task it tackles and w.r.t. the computer vision techniques that are used. Regarding applications, we subdivide the literature in two areas: Monitoring, i.e. observing and retrieving relevant information from the environment, and manipulation, where approaches are used to analyze and interact with the environment. Additionally, we point out directions for future research and link to recent developments in computer vision that are suitable for application in logistics. Finally, we present an overview of existing datasets and industrial solutions. The results of our analysis are also available online at https://a-nau.github.io/cv-in-logistics."
"Title: Multi-perspective Information Fusion Res2Net with RandomSpecmix for Fake Speech Detection
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the multi-perspective information fusion (MPIF) Res2Net with random Specmix for fake speech detection (FSD). The main purpose of this system is to improve the model's ability to learn precise forgery information for FSD task in low-quality scenarios. The task of random Specmix, a data augmentation, is to improve the generalization ability of the model and enhance the model's ability to locate discriminative information. Specmix cuts and pastes the frequency dimension information of the spectrogram in the same batch of samples without introducing other data, which helps the model to locate the really useful information. At the same time, we randomly select samples for augmentation to reduce the impact of data augmentation directly changing all the data. Once the purpose of helping the model to locate information is achieved, it is also important to reduce unnecessary information. The role of MPIF-Res2Net is to reduce redundant interference information. Deceptive information from a single perspective is always similar, so the model learning this similar information will produce redundant spoofing clues and interfere with truly discriminative information. The proposed MPIF-Res2Net fuses information from different perspectives, making the information learned by the model more diverse, thereby reducing the redundancy caused by similar information and avoiding interference with the learning of discriminative information. The results on the ASVspoof 2021 LA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving EER and min-tDCF of 3.29% and 0.2557, respectively.","Title: Learning From Yourself: A Self-Distillation Method for Fake Speech Detection
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-distillation method for fake speech detection (FSD), which can significantly improve the performance of FSD without increasing the model complexity. For FSD, some fine-grained information is very important, such as spectrogram defects, mute segments, and so on, which are often perceived by shallow networks. However, shallow networks have much noise, which can not capture this very well. To address this problem, we propose using the deepest network instruct shallow network for enhancing shallow networks. Specifically, the networks of FSD are divided into several segments, the deepest network being used as the teacher model, and all shallow networks become multiple student models by adding classifiers. Meanwhile, the distillation path between the deepest network feature and shallow network features is used to reduce the feature difference. A series of experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA and PA datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, with significant improvements compared to the baseline."

Abstract: We review how our earlier theorization of pattern methods fares in the wild. The""wild""here included a graduate school classroom in New York, a workshop at a transdisciplinary conference in Arizona, a nascent citizen science project in Bristol, and a professional development day for a university in Oxford. We encountered unexpected challenges such as working with students in a HyFlex classroom, getting conference attendees to feel comfortable evaluating the conference they were presently attending, and adapting our plans on the fly when leading workshops with surprising attendee responses. We describe and refine pattern specifications that will help other practitioners of patterns in their own forays into the wild.","Title: Designing explainable artificial intelligence with active inference: A framework for transparent introspection and decision-making
Abstract: This paper investigates the prospect of developing human-interpretable, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on active inference and the free energy principle. We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities."
"Title: NICOL: A Neuro-inspired Collaborative Semi-humanoid Robot that Bridges Social Interaction and Reliable Manipulation
Abstract: Robotic platforms that can efficiently collaborate with humans in physical tasks constitute a major goal in robotics. However, many existing robotic platforms are either designed for social interaction or industrial object manipulation tasks. The design of collaborative robots seldom emphasizes both their social interaction and physical collaboration abilities. To bridge this gap, we present the novel semi-humanoid NICOL, the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator. NICOL is a large, newly designed, scaled-up version of its well-evaluated predecessor, the Neuro-Inspired COmpanion (NICO). NICOL adopts NICO's head and facial expression display, and extends its manipulation abilities in terms of precision, object size and workspace size. To introduce and evaluate NICOL, we first develop and extend different neural and hybrid neuro-genetic visuomotor approaches initially developed for the NICO to the larger NICOL and its more complex kinematics. Furthermore, we present a novel neuro-genetic approach that improves the grasp-accuracy of the NICOL to over 99%, outperforming the state-of-the-art IK solvers KDL, TRACK-IK and BIO-IK. Furthermore, we introduce the social interaction capabilities of NICOL, including the auditory and visual capabilities, but also the face and emotion generation capabilities. Overall, this article presents for the first time the humanoid robot NICOL and, thereby, with the neuro-genetic approaches, contributes to the integration of social robotics and neural visuomotor learning for humanoid robots.","Title: CycleIK: Neuro-inspired Inverse Kinematics
Abstract: The paper introduces CycleIK, a neuro-robotic approach that wraps two novel neuro-inspired methods for the inverse kinematics (IK) task, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and a Multi-Layer Perceptron architecture. These methods can be used in a standalone fashion, but we also show how embedding these into a hybrid neuro-genetic IK pipeline allows for further optimization via sequential least-squares programming (SLSQP) or a genetic algorithm (GA). The models are trained and tested on dense datasets that were collected from random robot configurations of the new Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a semi-humanoid robot with two redundant 8-DoF manipulators. We utilize the weighted multi-objective function from the state-of-the-art BioIK method to support the training process and our hybrid neuro-genetic architecture. We show that the neural models can compete with state-of-the-art IK approaches, which allows for deployment directly to robotic hardware. Additionally, it is shown that the incorporation of the genetic algorithm improves the precision while simultaneously reducing the overall runtime."
"Title: Discrepancy-Based Active Learning for Weakly Supervised Bleeding Segmentation in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images
Abstract: nan","Title: EdgeAL: An Edge Estimation Based Active Learning Approach for OCT Segmentation
Abstract: Active learning algorithms have become increasingly popular for training models with limited data. However, selecting data for annotation remains a challenging problem due to the limited information available on unseen data. To address this issue, we propose EdgeAL, which utilizes the edge information of unseen images as {\it a priori} information for measuring uncertainty. The uncertainty is quantified by analyzing the divergence and entropy in model predictions across edges. This measure is then used to select superpixels for annotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeAL on multi-class Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) segmentation tasks, where we achieved a 99% dice score while reducing the annotation label cost to 12%, 2.3%, and 3%, respectively, on three publicly available datasets (Duke, AROI, and UMN).

"Title: Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation
Abstract: Robots should exist anywhere humans do: indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Our agent has no premapping and our formalism outperforms naive LLM-based approaches","Title: Sources of Hallucination by Large Language Models on Inference Tasks
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are claimed to be capable of Natural Language Inference (NLI), necessary for applied tasks like question answering and summarization, yet this capability is under-explored. We present a series of behavioral studies on several LLM families (LLaMA, GPT-3.5, and PaLM) which probe their behavior using controlled experiments. We establish two factors which predict much of their performance, and propose that these are major sources of hallucination in generative LLM. First, the most influential factor is memorization of the training data. We show that models falsely label NLI test samples as entailing when the hypothesis is attested in the training text, regardless of the premise. We further show that named entity IDs are used as""indices""to access the memorized data. Second, we show that LLMs exploit a further corpus-based heuristic using the relative frequencies of words. We show that LLMs score significantly worse on NLI test samples which do not conform to these factors than those which do; we also discuss a tension between the two factors, and a performance trade-off."
"Title: Larger is not Better: A Survey on the Robustness of Computer Vision Models against Common Corruptions
Abstract: The performance of computer vision models are susceptible to unexpected changes in input images, known as common corruptions (e.g. noise, blur, illumination changes, etc.), that can hinder their reliability when deployed in real scenarios. These corruptions are not always considered to test model generalization and robustness. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of methods that improve the robustness of computer vision models against common corruptions. We categorize methods into four groups based on the model part and training method addressed: data augmentation, representation learning, knowledge distillation, and network components. We also cover indirect methods for generalization and mitigation of shortcut learning, potentially useful for corruption robustness. We release a unified benchmark framework to compare robustness performance on several datasets, and address the inconsistencies of evaluation in the literature. We provide an experimental overview of the base corruption robustness of popular vision backbones, and show that corruption robustness does not necessarily scale with model size. The very large models (above 100M parameters) gain negligible robustness, considering the increased computational requirements. To achieve generalizable and robust computer vision models, we foresee the need of developing new learning strategies to efficiently exploit limited data and mitigate unwanted or unreliable learning behaviors.","Title: The RoboDepth Challenge: Methods and Advancements Towards Robust Depth Estimation
Abstract: Accurate depth estimation under out-of-distribution (OoD) scenarios, such as adverse weather conditions, sensor failure, and noise contamination, is desirable for safety-critical applications. Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website."
"Title: Secrets of RLHF in Large Language Models Part I: PPO
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have formulated a blueprint for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model. Based on our main results, we perform a comprehensive analysis of RLHF abilities compared with SFT models and ChatGPT. The absence of open-source implementations has posed significant challenges to the investigation of LLMs alignment. Therefore, we are eager to release technical reports, reward models and PPO codes, aiming to make modest contributions to the advancement of LLMs.","Title: Detecting and Preventing Hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models
Abstract: Instruction tuned Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced in generalizing across a diverse set of multi-modal tasks, especially for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, generating detailed responses that are visually grounded is still a challenging task for these models. We find that even the current state-of-the-art LVLMs (InstructBLIP) still contain a staggering 30 percent of the hallucinatory text in the form of non-existent objects, unfaithful descriptions, and inaccurate relationships. To address this, we introduce M-HalDetect, a (M)ultimodal (Hal)lucination (Detect)ion Dataset that can be used to train and benchmark models for hallucination detection and prevention. M-HalDetect consists of 16k fine-grained annotations on VQA examples, making it the first comprehensive multi-modal hallucination detection dataset for detailed image descriptions. Unlike previous work that only consider object hallucination, we additionally annotate both entity descriptions and relationships that are unfaithful. To demonstrate the potential of this dataset for hallucination prevention, we optimize InstructBLIP through our novel Fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (FDPO). We also train fine-grained multi-modal reward models from InstructBLIP and evaluate their effectiveness with best-of-n rejection sampling. We perform human evaluation on both FDPO and rejection sampling, and find that they reduce hallucination rates in InstructBLIP by 41% and 55% respectively. We also find that our reward model generalizes to other multi-modal models, reducing hallucinations in LLaVA and mPLUG-OWL by 15% and 57% respectively, and has strong correlation with human evaluated accuracy scores."
"Title: Approximating Human-Like Few-shot Learning with GPT-based Compression
Abstract: In this work, we conceptualize the learning process as information compression. We seek to equip generative pre-trained models with human-like learning capabilities that enable data compression during inference. We present a novel approach that utilizes the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to approximate Kolmogorov complexity, with the aim of estimating the optimal Information Distance for few-shot learning. We first propose using GPT as a prior for lossless text compression, achieving a noteworthy compression ratio. Experiment with LLAMA2-7B backbone achieves a compression ratio of 15.5 on enwik9. We justify the pre-training objective of GPT models by demonstrating its equivalence to the compression length, and, consequently, its ability to approximate the information distance for texts. Leveraging the approximated information distance, our method allows the direct application of GPT models in quantitative text similarity measurements. Experiment results show that our method overall achieves superior performance compared to embedding and prompt baselines on challenging NLP tasks, including semantic similarity, zero and one-shot text classification, and zero-shot text ranking.","Title: A Theory of Human-Like Few-Shot Learning
Abstract: We aim to bridge the gap between our common-sense few-sample human learning and large-data machine learning. We derive a theory of human-like few-shot learning from von-Neuman-Landauer's principle. modelling human learning is difficult as how people learn varies from one to another. Under commonly accepted definitions, we prove that all human or animal few-shot learning, and major models including Free Energy Principle and Bayesian Program Learning that model such learning, approximate our theory, under Church-Turing thesis. We find that deep generative model like variational autoencoder (VAE) can be used to approximate our theory and perform significantly better than baseline models including deep neural networks, for image recognition, low resource language processing, and character recognition."
"Title: Prompting Language-Informed Distribution for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning
Abstract: The compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task aims to recognize unseen compositional visual concepts (i.e., sliced tomatoes), where the models are learned only from the seen compositions (i.e., sliced potatoes and red tomatoes). Thanks to the prompt tuning on large pre-trained visual language models such as CLIP, recent literature shows impressively better CZSL performance than traditional vision-based methods. However, the key aspects that impact the generalization to unseen compositions, including the diversity and informativeness of class context, and the entanglement between visual primitives (i.e., states and objects), are not properly addressed in existing CLIP-based CZSL literature. In this paper, we propose a model by prompting the language-informed distribution, aka., PLID, for the CZSL task. Specifically, the PLID leverages pre-trained large language models (LLM) to 1) formulate the language-informed class distribution, and 2) enhance the compositionality of the softly prompted class embedding. Moreover, a stochastic logit mixup strategy is proposed to dynamically fuse the decisions from the predictions in the compositional and the primitive logit space. Orthogonal to the existing literature of soft, hard, or distributional prompts, our method advocates prompting the LLM-supported class distribution that leads to a better compositional zero-shot generalization. Experimental results on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA datasets show the superior performance of the PLID to the prior arts. The code and models will be publicly released.","Title: Residual Prompt Tuning: Improving Prompt Tuning with Residual Reparameterization
Abstract: Prompt tuning is one of the successful approaches for parameter-efficient tuning of pre-trained language models. Despite being arguably the most parameter-efficient (tuned soft prompts constitute<0.1% of total parameters), it typically performs worse than other efficient tuning methods and is quite sensitive to hyper-parameters. In this work, we introduce Residual Prompt Tuning - a simple and efficient method that significantly improves the performance and stability of prompt tuning. We propose to reparameterize soft prompt embeddings using a shallow network with a residual connection. Our experiments show that Residual Prompt Tuning significantly outperforms prompt tuning on SuperGLUE benchmark. Notably, our method reaches +7 points improvement over prompt tuning with T5-Base and allows to reduce the prompt length by 10x without hurting performance. In addition, we show that our approach is robust to the choice of learning rate and prompt initialization, and is effective in few-shot settings."
"Title: Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. Fig. 1 shows some visualization results on ImageNet. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.","Title: CiCo: Domain-Aware Sign Language Retrieval via Cross-Lingual Contrastive Learning
Abstract: This work focuses on sign language retrieval—a recently proposed task for sign language understanding. Sign language retrieval consists of two sub-tasks: text-to-sign-video (T2V) retrieval and sign-video-to-text (V2T) retrieval. Different from traditional video-text retrieval, sign language videos, not only contain visual signals but also carry abundant semantic meanings by themselves due to the fact that sign languages are also natural languages. Considering this character, we formulate sign language retrieval as a cross-lingual retrieval problem as well as a video-text retrieval task. Concretely, we take into account the linguistic properties of both sign languages and natural languages, and simultaneously identify the fine-grained cross-lingual (i.e., sign-to-word) mappings while contrasting the texts and the sign videos in a joint embedding space. This process is termed as cross-lingual contrastive learning. Another challenge is raised by the data scarcity issue—sign language datasets are orders of magnitude smaller in scale than that of speech recognition. We alleviate this issue by adopting a domain-agnostic sign encoder pre-trained on large-scale sign videos into the target domain via pseudo-labeling. Our framework, termed as domain-aware sign language retrieval via Cross-lingual Contrastive learning or CiCo for short, outperforms the pioneering method by large margins on various datasets, e.g., +22.4 T2V and +28.0 V2T R@1 improvements on How2Sign dataset, and +13.7 T2V and +17.1 V2T R@1 improvements on PHOENIX-2014T dataset.

"Title: Towards Expert-Level Medical Question Answering with Large Language Models
Abstract: Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in""grand challenges""ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a""passing""score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p<0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p<0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form""adversarial""questions to probe LLM limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.","Title: PRISMA-DFLLM: An Extension of PRISMA for Systematic Literature Reviews using Domain-specific Finetuned Large Language Models
Abstract: With the proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and efficient finetuning techniques, we are on the cusp of the emergence of numerous domain-specific LLMs that have been finetuned for expertise across specialized fields and applications for which the current general-purpose LLMs are unsuitable. In academia, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs), access knowledge and generate new insights. This paper proposes an AI-enabled methodological framework that combines the power of LLMs with the rigorous reporting guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). By finetuning LLMs on domain-specific academic papers that have been selected as a result of a rigorous SLR process, the proposed PRISMA-DFLLM (for Domain-specific Finetuned LLMs) reporting guidelines offer the potential to achieve greater efficiency, reusability and scalability, while also opening the potential for conducting incremental living systematic reviews with the aid of LLMs. Additionally, the proposed approach for leveraging LLMs for SLRs enables the dissemination of finetuned models, empowering researchers to accelerate advancements and democratize cutting-edge research. This paper presents the case for the feasibility of finetuned LLMs to support rigorous SLRs and the technical requirements for realizing this. This work then proposes the extended PRISMA-DFLLM checklist of reporting guidelines as well as the advantages, challenges, and potential implications of implementing PRISMA-DFLLM. Finally, a future research roadmap to develop this line of AI-enabled SLRs is presented, paving the way for a new era of evidence synthesis and knowledge discovery."
"Title: Generative Recommendation: Towards Next-generation Recommender Paradigm
Abstract: Recommender systems typically retrieve items from an item corpus for personalized recommendations. However, such a retrieval-based recommender paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users usually adjust the recommendations via passive and inefficient feedback such as clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success across various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations: 1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific information needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates users to express information needs more precisely via natural language instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user instructions to guide content generation. To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and leverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs. Specifically, we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback (e.g., clicks) via an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items, respectively. Eventually, GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to meet users' information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated items, we emphasize various fidelity checks such as authenticity and legality checks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing the AI editor and AI creator on micro-video generation, showing promising results.","Title: RecAD: Towards A Unified Library for Recommender Attack and Defense
Abstract: In recent years, recommender systems have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, while they suffer from a high risk of being attacked due to the growing commercial and social values. Despite significant research progress in recommender attack and defense, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in the field, leading to unfair performance comparison and limited credibility of experiments. To address this, we propose RecAD, a unified library aiming at establishing an open benchmark for recommender attack and defense. RecAD takes an initial step to set up a unified benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research by integrating diverse datasets, standard source codes, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, attack knowledge, attack budget, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed to be comprehensive and sustainable, covering both attack, defense, and evaluation tasks, enabling more researchers to easily follow and contribute to this promising field. RecAD will drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems attack and defense, reduce the redundant efforts of researchers, and ultimately increase the credibility and practical value of recommender attack and defense. The project is released at https://github.com/gusye1234/recad."
"Title: LLMRec: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Recommendation Task
Abstract: Recently, the fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly advanced NLP tasks by enhancing the capabilities of conversational models. However, the application of LLMs in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. To bridge this gap, we propose LLMRec, a LLM-based recommender system designed for benchmarking LLMs on various recommendation tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several popular off-the-shelf LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, ChatGLM, on five recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct recommendation, explanation generation, and review summarization. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of supervised finetuning to improve LLMs' instruction compliance ability. The benchmark results indicate that LLMs displayed only moderate proficiency in accuracy-based tasks such as sequential and direct recommendation. However, they demonstrated comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in explainability-based tasks. We also conduct qualitative evaluations to further evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models, and the results show that LLMs can truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results. We aspire that this benchmark will serve as an inspiration for researchers to delve deeper into the potential of LLMs in enhancing recommendation performance. Our codes, processed data and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/williamliujl/LLMRec.","Title: LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention
Abstract: We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach. Code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter."
"Title: TPTU: Task Planning and Tool Usage of Large Language Model-based AI Agents
Abstract: With recent advancements in natural language processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various real-world applications. Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems. Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying areas that need more investigation and improvement.","Title: Few-shot Fine-tuning vs. In-context Learning: A Fair Comparison and Evaluation
Abstract: Few-shot fine-tuning and in-context learning are two alternative strategies for task adaptation of pre-trained language models. Recently, in-context learning has gained popularity over fine-tuning due to its simplicity and improved out-of-domain generalization, and because extensive evidence shows that fine-tuned models pick up on spurious correlations. Unfortunately, previous comparisons of the two approaches were done using models of different sizes. This raises the question of whether the observed weaker out-of-domain generalization of fine-tuned models is an inherent property of fine-tuning or a limitation of the experimental setup. In this paper, we compare the generalization of few-shot fine-tuning and in-context learning to challenge datasets, while controlling for the models used, the number of examples, and the number of parameters, ranging from 125M to 30B. Our results show that fine-tuned language models can in fact generalize well out-of-domain. We find that both approaches generalize similarly; they exhibit large variation and depend on properties such as model size and the number of examples, highlighting that robust task adaptation remains a challenge."
"Title: Causal Document-Grounded Dialogue Pre-training
Abstract: The goal of document-grounded dialogue (DocGD) is to generate a response by grounding the evidence in a supporting document in accordance with the dialogue context. This process involves four variables that are causally connected. Recently, task-specific pre-training has greatly boosted performances on many downstream tasks. Existing DocGD methods, however, continue to rely on general pre-trained language models without a specifically tailored pre-training approach that explicitly captures the causal relationships. To tackle this issue, we are the first to present a causally-complete dataset construction strategy for building million-level DocGD pre-training corpora. To better capture causality, we further propose a causally-perturbed pre-training strategy, which introduces causal perturbations on the variables and optimizes the overall causal effect. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our causal pre-training achieves considerable and consistent improvements under fully-supervised, low-resource, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.","Title: Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators
Abstract: Measuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task, particularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with human preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans."
"Title: Bridge Diffusion Model: bridge non-English language-native text-to-image diffusion model with English communities
Abstract: Text-to-Image generation (TTI) technologies are advancing rapidly, especially in the English language communities. However, English-native TTI models inherently carry biases from English world centric training data, which creates a dilemma for development of other language-native TTI models. One common choice is fine-tuning the English-native TTI model with translated samples from non-English communities. It falls short of fully addressing the model bias problem. Alternatively, training non-English language native models from scratch can effectively resolve the English world bias, but diverges from the English TTI communities, thus not able to utilize the strides continuously gaining in the English TTI communities any more. To build non-English language native TTI model meanwhile keep compatability with the English TTI communities, we propose a novel model structure referred as""Bridge Diffusion Model""(BDM). The proposed BDM employs a backbone-branch network structure to learn the non-English language semantics while keep the latent space compatible with the English-native TTI backbone, in an end-to-end manner. The unique advantages of the proposed BDM are that it's not only adept at generating images that precisely depict non-English language semantics, but also compatible with various English-native TTI plugins, such as different checkpoints, LoRA, ControlNet, Dreambooth, and Textual Inversion, etc. Moreover, BDM can concurrently generate content seamlessly combining both non-English native and English-native semantics within a single image, fostering cultural interaction. We verify our method by applying BDM to build a Chinese-native TTI model, whereas the method is generic and applicable to any other language.","Title: Stable Bias: Analyzing Societal Representations in Diffusion Models
Abstract: As machine learning-enabled Text-to-Image (TTI) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent and seeing growing adoption as commercial services, characterizing the social biases they exhibit is a necessary first step to lowering their risk of discriminatory outcomes. This evaluation, however, is made more difficult by the synthetic nature of these systems' outputs; since artificial depictions of fictive humans have no inherent gender or ethnicity nor do they belong to socially-constructed groups, we need to look beyond common categorizations of diversity or representation. To address this need, we propose a new method for exploring and quantifying social biases in TTI systems by directly comparing collections of generated images designed to showcase a system's variation across social attributes -- gender and ethnicity -- and target attributes for bias evaluation -- professions and gender-coded adjectives. Our approach allows us to (i) identify specific bias trends through visualization tools, (ii) provide targeted scores to directly compare models in terms of diversity and representation, and (iii) jointly model interdependent social variables to support a multidimensional analysis. We use this approach to analyze over 96,000 images generated by 3 popular TTI systems (DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion v 1.4 and v 2) and find that all three significantly over-represent the portion of their latent space associated with whiteness and masculinity across target attributes; among the systems studied, DALL-E 2 shows the least diversity, followed by Stable Diffusion v2 then v1.4."
"Title: EditSum: A Retrieve-and-Edit Framework for Source Code Summarization
Abstract: Existing studies show that code summaries help developers understand and maintain source code. Unfortunately, these summaries are often missing or outdated in software projects. Code summarization aims to generate natural language descriptions automatically for source code. According to Gros et al., code summaries are highly structured and have repetitive patterns (e.g. ""return true if...""). Besides the patternized words, a code summary also contains important keywords, which are the key to reflecting the functionality of the code. However, the state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly on predicting the keywords, which leads to the generated summaries suffer a loss in informativeness. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a novel retrieve-and-edit approach named EditSum for code summarization. Specifically, EditSum first retrieves a similar code snippet from a pre-defined corpus and treats its summary as a prototype summary to learn the pattern. Then, EditSum edits the prototype automatically to combine the pattern in the prototype with the semantic information of input code. Our motivation is that the retrieved prototype provides a good start-point for post-generation because the summaries of similar code snippets often have the same pattern. The post-editing process further reuses the patternized words in prototype and generates keywords based on the semantic information of input code. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus (2M) and experimental results demonstrate that EditSum outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. The human evaluation also proves the summaries generated by EditSum are more informative and useful. We also verify that EditSum performs well on predicting the patternized words and keywords.","Title: Revisiting and Improving Retrieval-Augmented Deep Assertion Generation
Abstract: Unit testing validates the correctness of the unit under test and has become an essential activity in software development process. A unit test consists of a test prefix that drives the unit under test into a particular state, and a test oracle (e.g., assertion), which specifies the behavior in that state. To reduce manual efforts in conducting unit testing, Yu et al. proposed an integrated approach (integration for short), combining information retrieval (IR) with a deep learning-based approach, to generate assertions for a unit test. Despite promising, there is still a knowledge gap as to why or where integration works or does not work. In this paper, we describe an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of integration. Our analysis shows that: 1) The overall performance of integration is mainly due to its success in retrieving assertions. 2) integration struggles to understand the semantic differences between the retrieved focal-test (focal-test includes a test prefix and a unit under test) and the input focal-test; 3) integration is limited to specific types of edit operations and cannot handle token addition or deletion. To improve the effectiveness of assertion generation, this paper proposes a novel retrieve-and-edit approach named EditAS. Specifically, EditAS first retrieves a similar focal-test from a pre-defined corpus and treats its assertion as a prototype. Then, EditAS reuses the information in the prototype and edits the prototype automatically. EditAS is more generalizable than integration. We conduct experiments on two large-scale datasets and experimental results demonstrate that EditAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, with an average improvement of 10.00%-87.48% and 3.30%-42.65% in accuracy and BLEU score, respectively."
"Title: Decouple knowledge from parameters for plug-and-play language modeling
Abstract: Pre-trained language models(PLM) have made impressive results in various NLP tasks. It has been revealed that one of the key factors to their success is the parameters of these models implicitly learn all kinds of knowledge during pre-training. However, encoding knowledge implicitly in the model parameters has two fundamental drawbacks. First, the knowledge is neither editable nor scalable once the model is trained, which is especially problematic in that knowledge is consistently evolving. Second, it lacks interpretability and prevents humans from understanding which knowledge PLM requires for a certain problem. In this paper, we introduce PlugLM, a pre-training model with differentiable plug-in memory(DPM). The key intuition is to decouple the knowledge storage from model parameters with an editable and scalable key-value memory and leverage knowledge in an explainable manner by knowledge retrieval in the DPM. To justify this design choice, we conduct evaluations in three settings including: (1) domain adaptation. PlugLM obtains 3.95 F1 improvements across four domains on average without any in-domain pre-training. (2) knowledge update. PlugLM could absorb new knowledge in a training-free way after pre-training is done. (3) in-task knowledge learning. PlugLM could be further improved by incorporating training samples into DPM with knowledge prompting.","Title: Lift Yourself Up: Retrieval-augmented Text Generation with Self Memory
Abstract: With direct access to human-written reference as memory, retrieval-augmented generation has achieved much progress in a wide range of text generation tasks. Since better memory would typically prompt better generation~(we define this as primal problem). The traditional approach for memory retrieval involves selecting memory that exhibits the highest similarity to the input. However, this method is constrained by the quality of the fixed corpus from which memory is retrieved. In this paper, by exploring the duality of the primal problem: better generation also prompts better memory, we propose a novel framework, selfmem, which addresses this limitation by iteratively employing a retrieval-augmented generator to create an unbounded memory pool and using a memory selector to choose one output as memory for the subsequent generation round. This enables the model to leverage its own output, referred to as self-memory, for improved generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of selfmem on three distinct text generation tasks: neural machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and dialogue generation, under two generation paradigms: fine-tuned small model and few-shot LLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in four directions in JRC-Acquis, XSum (50.3 ROUGE-1), and BigPatent (62.9 ROUGE-1), demonstrating the potential of self-memory in enhancing retrieval-augmented generation models. Furthermore, we conduct thorough analyses of each component in the selfmem framework to identify bottlenecks and provide insights for future research."

Abstract: Review summarization is a non-trivial task that aims to summarize the main idea of the product review in the E-commerce website. Different from the document summary which only needs to focus on the main facts described in the document, review summarization should not only summarize the main aspects mentioned in the review but also reflect the personal style of the review author. Although existing review summarization methods have incorporated the historical reviews of both customer and product, they usually simply concatenate and indiscriminately model this two heterogeneous information into a long sequence. Moreover, the rating information can also provide a high-level abstraction of customer preference, it has not been used by the majority of methods. In this paper, we propose the Heterogeneous Historical Review aware Review Summarization Model (HHRRS) which separately models the two types of historical reviews with the rating information by a graph reasoning module with a contrastive loss. We employ a multi-task framework that conducts the review sentiment classification and summarization jointly. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HHRRS on both tasks."
"Title: Maximally Compact and Separated Features with Regular Polytope Networks
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained with the Softmax loss are widely used classiﬁcation models for several vision tasks. Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. the classiﬁer) is placed at the end of such models return-ing class scores that are further normalized into probabilities by Softmax. This learnable transformation has a fun-damental role in determining the network internal feature representation. In this work we show how to extract from CNNs features with the properties of maximum inter-class separability and maximum intra-class compactness by setting the parameters of the classiﬁer transformation as not trainable (i.e. ﬁxed). We obtain features similar to what can be obtained with the well-known “Center Loss” [1] and other similar approaches but with several practical advan-tages including maximal exploitation of the available feature space representation, reduction in the number of network parameters, no need to use other auxiliary losses be-sides the Softmax. Our approach uniﬁes and generalizes into a common approach two apparently different classes of methods regard-ing: discriminative features, pioneered by the Center Loss [1] and ﬁxed classiﬁers, ﬁrstly evaluated in [2]. Preliminary qualitative experimental results provide some insight on the potentialities of our combined strategy.","Title: Inducing Neural Collapse to a Fixed Hierarchy-Aware Frame for Reducing Mistake Severity
Abstract: There is a recently discovered and intriguing phenomenon called Neural Collapse: at the terminal phase of training a deep neural network for classification, the within-class penultimate feature means and the associated classifier vectors of all flat classes collapse to the vertices of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). Recent work has tried to exploit this phenomenon by fixing the related classifier weights to a pre-computed ETF to induce neural collapse and maximize the separation of the learned features when training with imbalanced data. In this work, we propose to fix the linear classifier of a deep neural network to a Hierarchy-Aware Frame (HAFrame), instead of an ETF, and use a cosine similarity-based auxiliary loss to learn hierarchy-aware penultimate features that collapse to the HAFrame. We demonstrate that our approach reduces the mistake severity of the model's predictions while maintaining its top-1 accuracy on several datasets of varying scales with hierarchies of heights ranging from 3 to 12.

"Title: Certified Robustness for Large Language Models with Self-Denoising
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in vast real-world applications, their vulnerabilities towards noisy inputs have significantly limited their uses, especially in high-stake environments. In these contexts, it is crucial to ensure that every prediction made by large language models is stable, i.e., LLM predictions should be consistent given minor differences in the input. This largely falls into the study of certified robust LLMs, i.e., all predictions of LLM are certified to be correct in a local region around the input. Randomized smoothing has demonstrated great potential in certifying the robustness and prediction stability of LLMs. However, randomized smoothing requires adding noise to the input before model prediction, and its certification performance depends largely on the model's performance on corrupted data. As a result, its direct application to LLMs remains challenging and often results in a small certification radius. To address this issue, we take advantage of the multitasking nature of LLMs and propose to denoise the corrupted inputs with LLMs in a self-denoising manner. Different from previous works like denoised smoothing, which requires training a separate model to robustify LLM, our method enjoys far better efficiency and flexibility. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms the existing certification methods under both certified robustness and empirical robustness. The codes are available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/SelfDenoise.","Title: Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) released for public use incorporate guardrails to ensure their output is safe, often referred to as""model alignment.""An aligned language model should decline a user's request to produce harmful content. However, such safety measures are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which contain maliciously designed token sequences to circumvent the model's safety guards and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework to defend against adversarial prompts with verifiable safety guarantees. We erase tokens individually and inspect the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our procedure labels the input prompt as harmful if any subsequences or the input prompt are detected as harmful by the filter. This guarantees that any adversarial modification of a harmful prompt up to a certain size is also labeled harmful. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, which appends an adversarial sequence at the end of the prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Empirical results demonstrate that our technique obtains strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good performance on safe prompts. For example, against adversarial suffixes of length 20, it certifiably detects 93% of the harmful prompts and labels 94% of the safe prompts as safe using the open source language model Llama 2 as the safety filter."
"Title: From Semi-supervised to Omni-supervised Room Layout Estimation Using Point Clouds
Abstract: Room layout estimation is a long-existing robotic vision task that benefits both environment sensing and motion planning. However, layout estimation using point clouds (PCs) still suffers from data scarcity due to annotation difficulty. As such, we address the semi-supervised setting of this task based upon the idea of model exponential moving averaging. But adapting this scheme to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for PC-based layout estimation is not straightforward. To this end, we define a quad set matching strategy and several consistency losses based upon metrics tailored for layout quads. Besides, we propose a new online pseudo-label harvesting algorithm that decomposes the distribution of a hybrid distance measure between quads and PC into two components. This technique does not need manual threshold selection and intuitively encourages quads to align with reliable layout points. Surprisingly, this framework also works for the fully-supervised setting, achieving a new SOTA on the ScanNet benchmark. Last but not least, we also push the semi-supervised setting to the realistic omni-supervised setting, demonstrating significantly promoted performance on a newly annotated ARKitScenes testing set. Our codes, data and models are made publicly available**Code: https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Omni-PQ.","Title: STRAP: Structured Object Affordance Segmentation with Point Supervision
Abstract: With significant annotation savings, point supervision has been proven effective for numerous 2D and 3D scene understanding problems. This success is primarily attributed to the structured output space; i.e., samples with high spatial affinity tend to share the same labels. Sharing this spirit, we study affordance segmentation with point supervision, wherein the setting inherits an unexplored dual affinity-spatial affinity and label affinity. By label affinity, we refer to affordance segmentation as a multi-label prediction problem: A plate can be both holdable and containable. By spatial affinity, we refer to a universal prior that nearby pixels with similar visual features should share the same point annotation. To tackle label affinity, we devise a dense prediction network that enhances label relations by effectively densifying labels in a new domain (i.e., label co-occurrence). To address spatial affinity, we exploit a Transformer backbone for global patch interaction and a regularization loss. In experiments, we benchmark our method on the challenging CAD120 dataset, showing significant performance gains over prior methods."
"Title: KGNv2: Separating Scale and Pose Prediction for Keypoint-based 6-DoF Grasp Synthesis on RGB-D input
Abstract: We propose a new 6-DoF grasp pose synthesis approach from 2D/2.5D input based on keypoints. Keypoint-based grasp detector from image input has demonstrated promising results in the previous study, where the additional visual information provided by color images compensates for the noisy depth perception. However, it relies heavily on accurately predicting the location of keypoints in the image space. In this paper, we devise a new grasp generation network that reduces the dependency on precise keypoint estimation. Given an RGB-D input, our network estimates both the grasp pose from keypoint detection as well as scale towards the camera. We further re-design the keypoint output space in order to mitigate the negative impact of keypoint prediction noise to Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline by a large margin, validating the efficacy of our approach. Finally, despite trained on simple synthetic objects, our method demonstrate sim-to-real capacity by showing competitive results in real-world robot experiments.","Title: Learning Any-View 6DoF Robotic Grasping in Cluttered Scenes via Neural Surface Rendering
Abstract: Robotic manipulation is critical for admitting robotic agents to various application domains, like intelligent assistance. A major challenge therein is the effective 6DoF grasping of objects in cluttered environments from any viewpoint without requiring additional scene exploration. We introduce $\textit{NeuGraspNet}$, a novel method for 6DoF grasp detection that leverages recent advances in neural volumetric representations and surface rendering. Our approach learns both global (scene-level) and local (grasp-level) neural surface representations, enabling effective and fully implicit 6DoF grasp quality prediction, even in unseen parts of the scene. Further, we reinterpret grasping as a local neural surface rendering problem, allowing the model to encode the interaction between the robot's end-effector and the object's surface geometry. NeuGraspNet operates on single viewpoints and can sample grasp candidates in occluded scenes, outperforming existing implicit and semi-implicit baseline methods in the literature. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of NeuGraspNet with a mobile manipulator robot, grasping in open spaces with clutter by rendering the scene, reasoning about graspable areas of different objects, and selecting grasps likely to succeed without colliding with the environment.

"Title: Informed Named Entity Recognition Decoding for Generative Language Models
Abstract: Ever-larger language models with ever-increasing capabilities are by now well-established text processing tools. Alas, information extraction tasks such as named entity recognition are still largely unaffected by this progress as they are primarily based on the previous generation of encoder-only transformer models. Here, we propose a simple yet effective approach, Informed Named Entity Recognition Decoding (iNERD), which treats named entity recognition as a generative process. It leverages the language understanding capabilities of recent generative models in a future-proof manner and employs an informed decoding scheme incorporating the restricted nature of information extraction into open-ended text generation, improving performance and eliminating any risk of hallucinations. We coarse-tune our model on a merged named entity corpus to strengthen its performance, evaluate five generative language models on eight named entity recognition datasets, and achieve remarkable results, especially in an environment with an unknown entity class set, demonstrating the adaptability of the approach.","Title: FiNER: Financial Named Entity Recognition Dataset and Weak-Supervision Model
Abstract: The development of annotated datasets over the 21st century has helped us truly realize the power of deep learning. Most of the datasets created for the named-entity-recognition (NER) task are not domain specific. Finance domain presents specific challenges to the NER task and a domain specific dataset would help push the boundaries of finance research. In our work, we develop the first high-quality NER dataset for the finance domain. To set the benchmark for the dataset, we develop and test a weak-supervision-based framework for the NER task. We extend the current weak-supervision framework to make it employable for span-level classification. Our weak-ner framework and the dataset are publicly available on GitHub and Hugging Face."
"Title: Learning Decentralized Partially Observable Mean Field Control for Artificial Collective Behavior
Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have achieved success in various domains. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) remains a challenge in terms of decentralization, partial observability and scalability to many agents. Meanwhile, collective behavior requires resolution of the aforementioned challenges, and remains of importance to many state-of-the-art applications such as active matter physics, self-organizing systems, opinion dynamics, and biological or robotic swarms. Here, MARL via mean field control (MFC) offers a potential solution to scalability, but fails to consider decentralized and partially observable systems. In this paper, we enable decentralized behavior of agents under partial information by proposing novel models for decentralized partially observable MFC (Dec-POMFC), a broad class of problems with permutation-invariant agents allowing for reduction to tractable single-agent Markov decision processes (MDP) with single-agent RL solution. We provide rigorous theoretical results, including a dynamic programming principle, together with optimality guarantees for Dec-POMFC solutions applied to finite swarms of interest. Algorithmically, we propose Dec-POMFC-based policy gradient methods for MARL via centralized training and decentralized execution, together with policy gradient approximation guarantees. In addition, we improve upon state-of-the-art histogram-based MFC by kernel methods, which is of separate interest also for fully observable MFC. We evaluate numerically on representative collective behavior tasks such as adapted Kuramoto and Vicsek swarming models, being on par with state-of-the-art MARL. Overall, our framework takes a step towards RL-based engineering of artificial collective behavior via MFC.","Title: Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization for Mean-Field Games
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to bridge the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games, by studying how the optimal policies of agents evolve with the number of agents (population size) in mean-field games, an agent-centric perspective in contrast to the existing works focusing typically on the convergence of the empirical distribution of the population. To this end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent games with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form solution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy for each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy trained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges through the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions are three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better performance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent encoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the population size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we construct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural networks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population sizes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple environments show the significant superiority of PAPO over baselines, and the analysis of the evolution of the generated policies further deepens our understanding of the two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games."
"Title: Global Constraints with Prompting for Zero-Shot Event Argument Classification
Abstract: Determining the role of event arguments is a crucial subtask of event extraction. Most previous supervised models leverage costly annotations, which is not practical for open-domain applications. In this work, we propose to use global constraints with prompting to effectively tackles event argument classification without any annotation and task-specific training. Specifically, given an event and its associated passage, the model first creates several new passages by prefix prompts and cloze prompts, where prefix prompts indicate event type and trigger span, and cloze prompts connect each candidate role with the target argument span. Then, a pre-trained language model scores the new passages, making the initial prediction. Our novel prompt templates can easily adapt to all events and argument types without manual effort. Next, the model regularizes the prediction by global constraints exploiting cross-task, cross-argument, and cross-event relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model’s effectiveness: it outperforms the best zero-shot baselines by 12.5% and 10.9% F1 on ACE and ERE with given argument spans and by 4.3% and 3.3% F1, respectively, without given argument spans. We have made our code publicly available.","Title: COLA: Contextualized Commonsense Causal Reasoning from the Causal Inference Perspective
Abstract: Detecting commonsense causal relations (causation) between events has long been an essential yet challenging task. Given that events are complicated, an event may have different causes under various contexts. Thus, exploiting context plays an essential role in detecting causal relations. Meanwhile, previous works about commonsense causation only consider two events and ignore their context, simplifying the task formulation. This paper proposes a new task to detect commonsense causation between two events in an event sequence (i.e., context), called contextualized commonsense causal reasoning. We also design a zero-shot framework: COLA (Contextualized Commonsense Causality Reasoner) to solve the task from the causal inference perspective. This framework obtains rich incidental supervision from temporality and balances covariates from multiple timestamps to remove confounding effects. Our extensive experiments show that COLA can detect commonsense causality more accurately than baselines."
"Title: MindDial: Belief Dynamics Tracking with Theory-of-Mind Modeling for Situated Neural Dialogue Generation
Abstract: Humans talk in free-form while negotiating the expressed meanings or common ground. Despite the impressive conversational abilities of the large generative language models, they do not consider the individual differences in contextual understanding in a shared situated environment. In this work, we propose MindDial, a novel conversational framework that can generate situated free-form responses to negotiate common ground. We design an explicit mind module that can track three-level beliefs -- the speaker's belief, the speaker's prediction of the listener's belief, and the common belief based on the gap between the first two. Then the speaking act classification head will decide to continue to talk, end this turn, or take task-related action. We augment a common ground alignment dataset MutualFriend with belief dynamics annotation, of which the goal is to find a single mutual friend based on the free chat between two agents. Experiments show that our model with mental state modeling can resemble human responses when aligning common ground meanwhile mimic the natural human conversation flow. The ablation study further validates the third-level common belief can aggregate information of the first and second-order beliefs and align common ground more efficiently.","Title: MindGames: Targeting Theory of Mind in Large Language Models with Dynamic Epistemic Modal Logic
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) is a critical component of intelligence, yet accurately measuring it continues to be a subject of debate. Prior research has attempted to apply human ToM assessments to natural language processing models using either human-created standardized tests or rule-based templates. However, these methods primarily focus on simplistic reasoning and require further validation. In this study, we utilize dynamic epistemic logic, which has established overlaps with ToM, to generate more intricate problems. We also introduce novel verbalization techniques to express these problems using natural language. Our findings indicate that certain language model scaling (from 70M to 6B and 350M to 174B) does not consistently yield results better than random chance. While GPT-4 demonstrates improved epistemic reasoning capabilities, there is still room for enhancement.

"Title: On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks
Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been studied extensively through the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test. However, standard GNNs and the WL framework are inapplicable for geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space, such as biomolecules, materials, and other physical systems. In this work, we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation, reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation. Synthetic experiments supplementing our results are available at \url{https://github.com/chaitjo/geometric-gnn-dojo}","Title: Subequivariant Graph Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments
Abstract: Learning a shared policy that guides the locomotion of different agents is of core interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which leads to the study of morphology-agnostic RL. However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in the choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the agents within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for morphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments (3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet challenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the enlarged state-action space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, into the modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize to all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message exchange. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks, where our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches on single-task, multi-task, and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive ablations are also conducted to verify our design. Code and videos are available on our project page: https://alpc91.github.io/SGRL/."
"Title: Reactive Landing Controller for Quadruped Robots
Abstract: Quadruped robots are machines intended for challenging and harsh environments. Despite the progress in locomotion strategy, safely recovering from unexpected falls or planned drops is still an open problem. It is further made more difficult when high horizontal velocities are involved. In this work, we propose an optimization-based reactive Landing Controller that uses only proprioceptive measures for torque-controlled quadruped robots that free-fall on a flat horizontal ground, knowing neither the distance to the landing surface nor the flight time. Based on an estimate of the Center of Mass horizontal velocity, the method uses the Variable Height Springy Inverted Pendulum model for continuously recomputing the feet position while the robot is falling. In this way, the quadruped is ready to attain a successful landing in all directions, even in the presence of significant horizontal velocities. The method is demonstrated to dramatically enlarge the region of horizontal velocities that can be dealt with by a naive approach that keeps the feet still during the airborne stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a quadruped robot can successfully recover from falls with horizontal velocities up to 3 m/s in simulation. Experiments prove that the used platform, Go1, can successfully attain a stable standing configuration from falls with various horizontal velocity and different angular perturbations.","Title: Locosim: an Open-Source Cross-Platform Robotics Framework
Abstract: The architecture of a robotics software framework tremendously influences the effort and time it takes for end users to test new concepts in a simulation environment and to control real hardware. Many years of activity in the field allowed us to sort out crucial requirements for a framework tailored for robotics: modularity and extensibility, source code reusability, feature richness, and user-friendliness. We implemented these requirements and collected best practices in Locosim, a cross-platform framework for simulation and real hardware. In this paper, we describe the architecture of Locosim and illustrate some use cases that show its potential."
"Title: Translate Meanings, Not Just Words: IdiomKB's Role in Optimizing Idiomatic Translation with Language Models
Abstract: To translate well, machine translation (MT) systems and general-purposed language models (LMs) need a deep understanding of both source and target languages and cultures. Therefore, idioms, with their non-compositional nature, pose particular challenges for Transformer-based systems, as literal translations often miss the intended meaning. Traditional methods, which replace idioms using existing knowledge bases (KBs), often lack scale and context awareness. Addressing these challenges, our approach prioritizes context awareness and scalability, allowing for offline storage of idioms in a manageable KB size. This ensures efficient serving with smaller models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of idiomatic expressions. We introduce a multilingual idiom KB (IdiomKB) developed using large LMs to address this. This KB facilitates better translation by smaller models, such as BLOOMZ (7.1B), Alpaca (7B), and InstructGPT (6.7B), by retrieving idioms' figurative meanings. We present a novel, GPT-4-powered metric for human-aligned evaluation, demonstrating that IdiomKB considerably boosts model performance. Human evaluations further validate our KB's quality.","Title: Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning
Abstract: In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of goal-oriented scripts. Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (e.g., “make a cake”), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (e.g., “make a cake for diabetics”). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an over-generate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, Coscript, which consists of 55,000 scripts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the constrained language planning ability of LLMs, especially on constraint faithfulness. Furthermore, Coscript is demonstrated to be quite effective in endowing smaller LMs with constrained language planning ability."
"Title: Uncovering and Quantifying Social Biases in Code Generation
Abstract: With the popularity of automatic code generation tools, such as Copilot, the study of the potential hazards of these tools is gaining importance. In this work, we explore the social bias problem in pre-trained code generation models. We propose a new paradigm to construct code prompts and successfully uncover social biases in code generation models. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset along with three metrics to evaluate the overall social bias and fine-grained unfairness across different demographics. Experimental results on three pre-trained code generation models (Codex, InCoder, and CodeGen) with varying sizes, reveal severe social biases. Moreover, we conduct analysis to provide useful insights for further choice of code generation models with low social bias. (This work contains examples that potentially implicate stereotypes, associations, and other harms that could be offensive to individuals in certain social groups.)","Title: Delicate Textured Mesh Recovery from NeRF via Adaptive Surface Refinement
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have constituted a remarkable breakthrough in image-based 3D reconstruction. However, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely-adopted polygonal meshes and lack support from common 3D software and hardware, making their rendering and manipulation inefficient. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework that generates textured surface meshes from images. Our approach begins by efficiently initializing the geometry and view-dependency decomposed appearance with a NeRF. Subsequently, a coarse mesh is extracted, and an iterative surface refining algorithm is developed to adaptively adjust both vertex positions and face density based on re-projected rendering errors. We jointly refine the appearance with geometry and bake it into texture images for real-time rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior mesh quality and competitive rendering quality."
"Title: Can ChatGPT Enable ITS? The Case of Mixed Traffic Control via Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: The surge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has contributed to its growth as well as highlighted key challenges. However, defining objectives of RL agents in traffic control and management tasks, as well as aligning policies with these goals through an effective formulation of Markov Decision Process (MDP), can be challenging and often require domain experts in both RL and ITS. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 highlight their broad general knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and commonsense priors across various domains. In this work, we conduct a large-scale user study involving 70 participants to investigate whether novices can leverage ChatGPT to solve complex mixed traffic control problems. Three environments are tested, including ring road, bottleneck, and intersection. We find ChatGPT has mixed results. For intersection and bottleneck, ChatGPT increases number of successful policies by 150% and 136% compared to solely beginner capabilities, with some of them even outperforming experts. However, ChatGPT does not provide consistent improvements across all scenarios.","Title: Efficient Quality-Diversity Optimization through Diverse Quality Species
Abstract: A prevalent limitation of optimizing over a single objective is that it can be misguided, becoming trapped in local optimum. This can be rectified by Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, where a population of high-quality and diverse solutions to a problem is preferred. Most conventional QD approaches, for example, MAP-Elites, explicitly manage a behavioral archive where solutions are broken down into predefined niches. In this work, we show that a diverse population of solutions can be found without the limitation of needing an archive or defining the range of behaviors in advance. Instead, we break down solutions into independently evolving species and use unsupervised skill discovery to learn diverse, high-performing solutions. We show that this can be done through gradient-based mutations that take on an information theoretic perspective of jointly maximizing mutual information and performance. We propose Diverse Quality Species (DQS) as an alternative to archive-based QD algorithms. We evaluate it over several simulated robotic environments and show that it can learn a diverse set of solutions from varying species. Furthermore, our results show that DQS is more sample-efficient and performant when compared to other QD algorithms.

"Title: DR2: Diffusion-Based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face Restoration
Abstract: Blind face restoration usually synthesizes degraded low-quality data with a pre-defined degradation model for training, while more complex cases could happen in the real world. This gap between the assumed and actual degradation hurts the restoration performance where artifacts are often observed in the output. However, it is expensive and infeasible to include every type of degradation to cover real-world cases in the training data. To tackle this robustness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2) to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression) and compatible with different designs of enhancement modules. Experiments in various settings show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded synthetic and real-world datasets.","Title: Beta Diffusion
Abstract: We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges. Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time. Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs, which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models, thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them."
"Title: The MiniPile Challenge for Data-Efficient Language Models
Abstract: The ever-growing diversity of pre-training text corpora has equipped language models with generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks. However, such diverse datasets are often too large for academic budgets; hence, most research on Transformer architectures, training procedures, optimizers, etc. gets conducted on smaller, homogeneous datasets. To this end, we present The MiniPile Challenge, where one pre-trains a language model on a diverse text corpus containing at most 1M documents. MiniPile is a 6GB subset of the deduplicated 825GB The Pile corpus. To curate MiniPile, we perform a simple, three-step data filtering process: we (1) infer embeddings for all documents of the Pile, (2) cluster the embedding space using $k$-means, and (3) filter out low-quality clusters. To verify MiniPile's suitability for language model pre-training, we use it to pre-train a BERT and T5 model, yielding a performance drop of only $1.9\%$/$2.5\%$ on the GLUE and SNI benchmarks compared to the original pre-trained checkpoints trained on $2.6$x/$745$x the amount of data. MiniPile is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JeanKaddour/minipile.","Title: Eliciting Latent Predictions from Transformers with the Tuned Lens
Abstract: We analyze transformers from the perspective of iterative inference, seeking to understand how model predictions are refined layer by layer. To do so, we train an affine probe for each block in a frozen pretrained model, making it possible to decode every hidden state into a distribution over the vocabulary. Our method, the tuned lens, is a refinement of the earlier""logit lens""technique, which yielded useful insights but is often brittle. We test our method on various autoregressive language models with up to 20B parameters, showing it to be more predictive, reliable and unbiased than the logit lens. With causal experiments, we show the tuned lens uses similar features to the model itself. We also find the trajectory of latent predictions can be used to detect malicious inputs with high accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid development of geometric deep learning techniques, many mesh-based convolutional operators have been proposed to bridge irregular mesh structures and popular backbone networks. In this paper, we show that while convolutions are helpful, a simple architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is competent enough to deal with mesh classification and semantic segmentation. Our new network architecture, named Mesh-MLP, takes mesh vertices equipped with the heat kernel signature (HKS) and dihedral angles as the input, replaces the convolution module of a ResNet with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and utilizes layer normalization (LN) to perform the normalization of the layers. The all-MLP architecture operates in an end-to-end fashion and does not include a pooling module. Extensive experimental results on the mesh classification/segmentation tasks validate the effectiveness of the all-MLP architecture.","Title: ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders
Abstract: Driven by improved architectures and better representation learning frameworks, the field of visual recognition has enjoyed rapid modernization and performance boost in the early 2020s. For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt [33], have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE) [14]. However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9% accuracy using only public training data."
"Title: Amortised Invariance Learning for Contrastive Self-Supervision
Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning methods famously produce high quality transferable representations by learning invariances to different data augmentations. Invariances established during pre-training can be interpreted as strong inductive biases. However these may or may not be helpful, depending on if they match the invariance requirements of downstream tasks or not. This has led to several attempts to learn task-specific invariances during pre-training, however, these methods are highly compute intensive and tedious to train. We introduce the notion of amortised invariance learning for contrastive self supervision. In the pre-training stage, we parameterize the feature extractor by differentiable invariance hyper-parameters that control the invariances encoded by the representation. Then, for any downstream task, both linear readout and task-specific invariance requirements can be efficiently and effectively learned by gradient-descent. We evaluate the notion of amortised invariances for contrastive learning over two different modalities: vision and audio, on two widely-used contrastive learning methods in vision: SimCLR and MoCo-v2 with popular architectures like ResNets and Vision Transformers, and SimCLR with ResNet-18 for audio. We show that our amortised features provide a reliable way to learn diverse downstream tasks with different invariance requirements, while using a single feature and avoiding task-specific pre-training. This provides an exciting perspective that opens up new horizons in the field of general purpose representation learning.","Title: Meta Omnium: A Benchmark for General-Purpose Learning-to-Learn
Abstract: Meta-learning and other approaches to few-shot learning are widely studied for image recognition, and are increasingly applied to other vision tasks such as pose estimation and dense prediction. This naturally raises the question of whether there is any fewshot metalearning algorithm capable of generalizing across these diverse task types? To support the community in answering this question, we introduce Meta Omnium, a dataset-of-datasets spanning multiple vision tasks including recognition, keypoint localization, semantic segmentation and regression. We experiment with popular fewshot metalearning baselines and analyze their ability to generalize across tasks and to transfer knowledge between them. Meta Omnium enables metalearning researchers to evaluate model generalization to a much wider array of tasks than previously possible, and provides a single framework for evaluating meta-learners across a wide suite of vision applications in a consistent manner. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/edi-meta-learning/meta-omnium."
"Title: Sequential Integrated Gradients: a simple but effective method for explaining language models
Abstract: Several explanation methods such as Integrated Gradients (IG) can be characterised as path-based methods, as they rely on a straight line between the data and an uninformative baseline. However, when applied to language models, these methods produce a path for each word of a sentence simultaneously, which could lead to creating sentences from interpolated words either having no clear meaning, or having a significantly different meaning compared to the original sentence. In order to keep the meaning of these sentences as close as possible to the original one, we propose Sequential Integrated Gradients (SIG), which computes the importance of each word in a sentence by keeping fixed every other words, only creating interpolations between the baseline and the word of interest. Moreover, inspired by the training procedure of several language models, we also propose to replace the baseline token""pad""with the trained token""mask"". While being a simple improvement over the original IG method, we show on various models and datasets that SIG proves to be a very effective method for explaining language models.","Title: Journey to the Center of the Knowledge Neurons: Discoveries of Language-Independent Knowledge Neurons and Degenerate Knowledge Neurons
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) contain vast amounts of factual knowledge, but how the knowledge is stored in the parameters remains unclear. This paper delves into the complex task of understanding how factual knowledge is stored in multilingual PLMs, and introduces the Architecture-adapted Multilingual Integrated Gradients method, which successfully localizes knowledge neurons more precisely compared to current methods, and is more universal across various architectures and languages. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth exploration of knowledge neurons, leading to the following two important discoveries: (1) The discovery of Language-Independent Knowledge Neurons, which store factual knowledge in a form that transcends language. We design cross-lingual knowledge editing experiments, demonstrating that the PLMs can accomplish this task based on language-independent neurons; (2) The discovery of Degenerate Knowledge Neurons, a novel type of neuron showing that different knowledge neurons can store the same fact. Its property of functional overlap endows the PLMs with a robust mastery of factual knowledge. We design fact-checking experiments, proving that the degenerate knowledge neurons can help the PLMs to detect wrong facts. Experiments corroborate these findings, shedding light on the mechanisms of factual knowledge storage in multilingual PLMs, and contribute valuable insights to the field. The source code will be made publicly available for further research."
"Title: GenAIPABench: A Benchmark for Generative AI-based Privacy Assistants
Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about the data management practices of organizations. Yet, their complexity often renders them largely incomprehensible to the average user, necessitating the development of privacy assistants. With the advent of generative AI (genAI) technologies, there is an untapped potential to enhance privacy assistants in answering user queries effectively. However, the reliability of genAI remains a concern due to its propensity for generating incorrect or misleading information. This study introduces GenAIPABench, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the performance of Generative AI-based Privacy Assistants (GenAIPAs). GenAIPABench comprises: 1) A comprehensive set of questions about an organization's privacy policy and a data protection regulation, along with annotated answers for several organizations and regulations; 2) A robust set of evaluation metrics for assessing the accuracy, relevance, and consistency of the generated responses; and 3) An evaluation tool that generates appropriate prompts to introduce the system to the privacy document and different variations of the privacy questions to evaluate its robustness. We use GenAIPABench to assess the potential of three leading genAI systems in becoming GenAIPAs: ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing AI. Our results demonstrate significant promise in genAI capabilities in the privacy domain while also highlighting challenges in managing complex queries, ensuring consistency, and verifying source accuracy.","Title: AgentBench: Evaluating LLMs as Agents
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly smart and autonomous, targeting real-world pragmatic missions beyond traditional NLP tasks. As a result, there has been an urgent need to evaluate LLMs as agents on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional evolving benchmark that currently consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities in a multi-turn open-ended generation setting. Our extensive test over 25 LLMs (including APIs and open-sourced models) shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and open-sourced competitors. It also serves as a component of an ongoing project with wider coverage and deeper consideration towards systematic LLM evaluation. Datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench"
"Title: Layout and Task Aware Instruction Prompt for Zero-shot Document Image Question Answering
Abstract: Layout-aware pre-trained models has achieved significant progress on document image question answering. They introduce extra learnable modules into existing language models to capture layout information within document images from text bounding box coordinates obtained by OCR tools. However, extra modules necessitate pre-training on extensive document images. This prevents these methods from directly utilizing off-the-shelf instruction-tuning language foundation models, which have recently shown promising potential in zero-shot learning. Instead, in this paper, we find that instruction-tuning language models like Claude and ChatGPT can understand layout by spaces and line breaks. Based on this observation, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Prompt (LATIN-Prompt), which consists of layout-aware document content and task-aware instruction. Specifically, the former uses appropriate spaces and line breaks to recover the layout information among text segments obtained by OCR tools, and the latter ensures that generated answers adhere to formatting requirements. Moreover, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Tuning (LATIN-Tuning) to improve the performance of small instruction-tuning models like Alpaca. Experimental results show that LATIN-Prompt enables zero-shot performance of Claude and ChatGPT to be comparable to the fine-tuning performance of SOTAs on document image question answering, and LATIN-Tuning enhances the zero-shot performance of Alpaca significantly. For example, LATIN-Prompt improves the performance of Claude and ChatGPT on DocVQA by 263% and 20% respectively. LATIN-Tuning improves the performance of Alpaca on DocVQA by 87.7%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of LATIN-Prompt and LATIN-Tuning. We provide the code in supplementary and will release it to facilitate future research.","Title: GeoLayoutLM: Geometric Pre-training for Visual Information Extraction
Abstract: Visual information extraction (VIE) plays an important role in Document Intelligence. Generally, it is divided into two tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE). Recently, pre-trained models for documents have achieved substantial progress in VIE, particularly in SER. However, most of the existing models learn the geometric representation in an implicit way, which has been found insufficient for the RE task since geometric information is especially crucial for RE. Moreover, we reveal another factor that limits the performance of RE lies in the objective gap between the pre-training phase and the finetuning phase for RE. To tackle these issues, we propose in this paper a multi-modal framework, named GeoLayoutLM, for VIE. GeoLayoutLM explicitly models the geometric relations in pre-training, which we call geometric pre-training. Geometric pre-training is achieved by three specially designed geometry-related pre-training tasks. Additionally, novel relation heads, which are pre-trained by the geometric pre-training tasks and fine-tuned for RE, are elaborately designed to enrich and enhance the feature representation. According to extensive experiments on standard VIE benchmarks, GeoLayoutLM achieves highly competitive scores in the SER task and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-arts for RE (e.g., the F1 score of RE on FUNSD is boosted from 80.35% to 89.45%) 11https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery."
"Title: Fairness of ChatGPT and the Role Of Explainable-Guided Prompts
Abstract: Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT, in credit risk assessment-a binary classification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when directed by judiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge, can parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Intriguingly, they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less, utilizing merely 20 data points compared to the ML's 800. LLMs particularly excel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness, both being vital aspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical ML models, they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks, laying a groundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse ML tasks.","Title: FaceChat: An Emotion-Aware Face-to-face Dialogue Framework

"Title: Aligning Robot and Human Representations
Abstract: To act in the world, robots rely on a representation of salient task aspects: for example, to carry a cup of coffee, a robot must consider movement efficiency and cup orientation in its behaviour. However, if we want robots to act for and with people, their representations must not be just functional but also reflective of what humans care about, i.e. their representations must be aligned with humans'. In this survey, we pose that current reward and imitation learning approaches suffer from representation misalignment, where the robot's learned representation does not capture the human's representation. We suggest that because humans will be the ultimate evaluator of robot performance in the world, it is critical that we explicitly focus our efforts on aligning learned task representations with humans, in addition to learning the downstream task. We advocate that current representation learning approaches in robotics should be studied from the perspective of how well they accomplish the objective of representation alignment. To do so, we mathematically define the problem, identify its key desiderata, and situate current robot learning methods within this formalism. We conclude the survey by suggesting future directions for exploring open challenges.","Title: A Markovian Formalism for Active Querying
Abstract: Active learning algorithms have been an integral part of recent advances in artificial intelligence. However, the research in the field is widely varying and lacks an overall organizing leans. We outline a Markovian formalism for the field of active learning and survey the literature to demonstrate the organizing capability of our proposed formalism. Our formalism takes a partially observable Markovian system approach to the active learning process as a whole. We specifically outline how querying, dataset augmentation, reward updates, and other aspects of active learning can be viewed as a transition between meta-states in a Markovian system, and give direction into how other aspects of active learning can fit into our formalism."
"Title: Characterizing Attribution and Fluency Tradeoffs for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models
Abstract: Despite recent progress, it has been difficult to prevent semantic hallucinations in generative Large Language Models. One common solution to this is augmenting LLMs with a retrieval system and making sure that the generated output is attributable to the retrieved information. Given this new added constraint, it is plausible to expect that the overall quality of the output will be affected, for example, in terms of fluency. Can scaling language models help? Here we examine the relationship between fluency and attribution in LLMs prompted with retrieved evidence in knowledge-heavy dialog settings. Our experiments were implemented with a set of auto-metrics that are aligned with human preferences. They were used to evaluate a large set of generations, produced under varying parameters of LLMs and supplied context. We show that larger models tend to do much better in both fluency and attribution, and that (naively) using top-k retrieval versus top-1 retrieval improves attribution but hurts fluency. We next propose a recipe that could allow smaller models to both close the gap with larger models and preserve the benefits of top-k retrieval while avoiding its drawbacks.","Title: Automatic Glossary of Clinical Terminology: a Large-Scale Dictionary of Biomedical Definitions Generated from Ontological Knowledge
Abstract: Background: More than 400.000 biomedical concepts and some of their relationships are contained in SnomedCT, a comprehensive biomedical ontology. However, their concept names are not always readily interpretable by non-experts, or patients looking at their own electronic health records (EHR). Clear definitions or descriptions in understandable language or often not available. Therefore, generating human-readable definitions for biomedical concepts might help make the information they encode more accessible and understandable to a wider public.Objective: In this article, we introduce the Automatic Glossary of Clinical Terminology (AGCT), a large-scale biomedical dictionary of clinical concepts generated using high-quality information extracted from the biomedical knowledge contained in SnomedCT.Methods: We generate a novel definition for every SnomedCT concept, after prompting the OpenAI Turbo model, a variant of GPT 3.5, using a high-quality verbalization of the SnomedCT relationships of the to-be-defined concept. A significant subset of the generated definitions was subsequently evaluated by NLP researchers with biomedical expertise on 5-point scales along the following three axes: factuality, insight, and fluency.Results: AGCT contains 422,070 computer-generated definitions for SnomedCT concepts, covering various domains such as diseases, procedures, drugs, and anatomy. The average length of the definitions is 49 words. The definitions were assigned average scores of over 4.5 out of 5 on all three axes, indicating a majority of factual, insightful, and fluent definitions.Conclusion: AGCT is a novel and valuable resource for biomedical tasks that require human-readable definitions for SnomedCT concepts. It can also serve as a base for developing robust biomedical retrieval models or other applications that leverage natural language understanding of biomedical knowledge."
"Title: DiffI2I: Efficient Diffusion Model for Image-to-Image Translation
Abstract: The Diffusion Model (DM) has emerged as the SOTA approach for image synthesis. However, the existing DM cannot perform well on some image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks. Different from image synthesis, some I2I tasks, such as super-resolution, require generating results in accordance with GT images. Traditional DMs for image synthesis require extensive iterations and large denoising models to estimate entire images, which gives their strong generative ability but also leads to artifacts and inefficiency for I2I. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple, efficient, and powerful DM framework for I2I, called DiffI2I. Specifically, DiffI2I comprises three key components: a compact I2I prior extraction network (CPEN), a dynamic I2I transformer (DI2Iformer), and a denoising network. We train DiffI2I in two stages: pretraining and DM training. For pretraining, GT and input images are fed into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact I2I prior representation (IPR) guiding DI2Iformer. In the second stage, the DM is trained to only use the input images to estimate the same IRP as CPEN$_{S1}$. Compared to traditional DMs, the compact IPR enables DiffI2I to obtain more accurate outcomes and employ a lighter denoising network and fewer iterations. Through extensive experiments on various I2I tasks, we demonstrate that DiffI2I achieves SOTA performance while significantly reducing computational burdens.","Title: SeaFormer: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Semantic Segmentation
Abstract: Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement render these methods unsuitable on the mobile device, especially for the high-resolution per-pixel semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial TransFormer (SeaFormer) for mobile semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobile-friendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification problem, demonstrating the potentials of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone."
"Title: A Practical Mixed Precision Algorithm for Post-Training Quantization
Abstract: Neural network quantization is frequently used to optimize model size, latency and power consumption for on-device deployment of neural networks. In many cases, a target bit-width is set for an entire network, meaning every layer get quantized to the same number of bits. However, for many networks some layers are significantly more robust to quantization noise than others, leaving an important axis of improvement unused. As many hardware solutions provide multiple different bit-width settings, mixed-precision quantization has emerged as a promising solution to find a better performance-efficiency trade-off than homogeneous quantization. However, most existing mixed precision algorithms are rather difficult to use for practitioners as they require access to the training data, have many hyper-parameters to tune or even depend on end-to-end retraining of the entire model. In this work, we present a simple post-training mixed precision algorithm that only requires a small unlabeled calibration dataset to automatically select suitable bit-widths for each layer for desirable on-device performance. Our algorithm requires no hyper-parameter tuning, is robust to data variation and takes into account practical hardware deployment constraints making it a great candidate for practical use. We experimentally validate our proposed method on several computer vision tasks, natural language processing tasks and many different networks, and show that we can find mixed precision networks that provide a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than their homogeneous bit-width equivalents.","Title: SAfER: Layer-Level Sensitivity Assessment for Efficient and Robust Neural Network Inference
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate outstanding performance across most computer vision tasks. Some critical applications, such as autonomous driving or medical imaging, also require investigation into their behavior and the reasons behind the decisions they make. In this vein, DNN attribution consists in studying the relationship between the predictions of a DNN and its inputs. Attribution methods have been adapted to highlight the most relevant weights or neurons in a DNN, allowing to more efficiently select which weights or neurons can be pruned. However, a limitation of these approaches is that weights are typically compared within each layer separately, while some layers might appear as more critical than others. In this work, we propose to investigate DNN layer importance, i.e. to estimate the sensitivity of the accuracy w.r.t. perturbations applied at the layer level. To do so, we propose a novel dataset to evaluate our method as well as future works. We benchmark a number of criteria and draw conclusions regarding how to assess DNN layer importance and, consequently, how to budgetize layers for increased DNN efficiency (with applications for DNN pruning and quantization), as well as robustness to hardware failure (e.g. bit swaps)."
"Title: The Capacity for Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models
Abstract: We test the hypothesis that language models trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have the capability to""morally self-correct""-- to avoid producing harmful outputs -- if instructed to do so. We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs. We believe our results are cause for cautious optimism regarding the ability to train language models to abide by ethical principles.","Title: AI Safety Subproblems for Software Engineering Researchers

We briefly summarize long-term AI Safety, and the challenge of avoiding harms from AI as systems meet or exceed human capabilities, including software engineering capabilities (and approach AGI /""HLMI""). We perform a quantified literature review suggesting that AI Safety discussions are not common at SE venues. We make conjectures about how software might change with rising capabilities, and categorize""subproblems""which fit into traditional SE areas, proposing how work on similar problems might improve the future of AI and SE."
"Title: Retrieval-Enhanced Contrastive Vision-Text Models
Abstract: Contrastive image-text models such as CLIP form the building blocks of many state-of-the-art systems. While they excel at recognizing common generic concepts, they still struggle on fine-grained entities which are rare, or even absent from the pre-training dataset. Hence, a key ingredient to their success has been the use of large-scale curated pre-training data aiming at expanding the set of concepts that they can memorize during the pre-training stage. In this work, we explore an alternative to encoding fine-grained knowledge directly into the model's parameters: we instead train the model to retrieve this knowledge from an external memory. Specifically, we propose to equip existing vision-text models with the ability to refine their embedding with cross-modal retrieved information from a memory at inference time, which greatly improves their zero-shot predictions. Remarkably, we show that this can be done with a light-weight, single-layer, fusion transformer on top of a frozen CLIP. Our experiments validate that our retrieval-enhanced contrastive (RECO) training improves CLIP performance substantially on several challenging fine-grained tasks: for example +10.9 on Stanford Cars, +10.2 on CUB-2011 and +7.3 on the recent OVEN benchmark.","Title: Differentiable Retrieval Augmentation via Generative Language Modeling for E-commerce Query Intent Classification
Abstract: Retrieval augmentation, which enhances downstream models by a knowledge retriever and an external corpus instead of by merely increasing the number of model parameters, has been successfully applied to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, question answering and so on. However, existing methods that separately or asynchronously train the retriever and downstream model mainly due to the non-differentiability between the two parts, usually lead to degraded performance compared to end-to-end joint training. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Retrieval Augmentation via Generative lANguage modeling(Dragan), to address this problem by a novel differentiable reformulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a challenging NLP task in e-commerce search, namely query intent classification. Both the experimental results and ablation study show that the proposed method significantly and reasonably improves the state-of-the-art baselines on both offline evaluation and online A/B test."
"Title: Dynamic Storyboard Generation in an Engine-based Virtual Environment for Video Production
Abstract: Amateurs working on mini-films and short-form videos usually spend lots of time and effort on the multi-round complicated process of setting and adjusting scenes, plots, and cameras to deliver satisfying video shots. We present Virtual Dynamic Storyboard (VDS) to allow users storyboarding shots in virtual environments, where the filming staff can easily test the settings of shots before the actual filming. VDS runs on a""propose-simulate-discriminate""mode: Given a formatted story script and a camera script as input, it generates several character animation and camera movement proposals following predefined story and cinematic rules to allow an off-the-shelf simulation engine to render videos. To pick up the top-quality dynamic storyboard from the candidates, we equip it with a shot ranking discriminator based on shot quality criteria learned from professional manual-created data. VDS is comprehensively validated via extensive experiments and user studies, demonstrating its efficiency, effectiveness, and great potential in assisting amateur video production.","Title: SynBody: Synthetic Dataset with Layered Human Models for 3D Human Perception and Modeling
Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising source for 3D human research as it offers low-cost access to large-scale human datasets. To advance the diversity and annotation quality of human models, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, SynBody, with three appealing features: 1) a clothed parametric human model that can generate a diverse range of subjects; 2) the layered human representation that naturally offers high-quality 3D annotations to support multiple tasks; 3) a scalable system for producing realistic data to facilitate real-world tasks. The dataset comprises 1.2M images with corresponding accurate 3D annotations, covering 10,000 human body models, 1,187 actions, and various viewpoints. The dataset includes two subsets for human pose and shape estimation as well as human neural rendering. Extensive experiments on SynBody indicate that it substantially enhances both SMPL and SMPL-X estimation. Furthermore, the incorporation of layered annotations offers a valuable training resource for investigating the Human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)."
"Title: Aligning Text-to-Image Models using Human Feedback
Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis. However, current text-to-image models often generate images that are inadequately aligned with text prompts. We propose a fine-tuning method for aligning such models using human feedback, comprising three stages. First, we collect human feedback assessing model output alignment from a set of diverse text prompts. We then use the human-labeled image-text dataset to train a reward function that predicts human feedback. Lastly, the text-to-image model is fine-tuned by maximizing reward-weighted likelihood to improve image-text alignment. Our method generates objects with specified colors, counts and backgrounds more accurately than the pre-trained model. We also analyze several design choices and find that careful investigations on such design choices are important in balancing the alignment-fidelity tradeoffs. Our results demonstrate the potential for learning from human feedback to significantly improve text-to-image models.","Title: AIGC In China: Current Developments And Future Outlook

"Title: Visual-Language Prompt Tuning with Knowledge-Guided Context Optimization
Abstract: Prompt tuning is an effective way to adapt the pretrained visual-language model (VLM) to the downstream task using task-related textual tokens. Representative CoOp-based work combines the learnable textual tokens with the class tokens to obtain specific textual knowledge. However, the specific textual knowledge is worse generalization to the unseen classes because it forgets the essential general textual knowledge having a strong generalization ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel Knowledge-guided Context Optimization (KgCoOp) to enhance the generalization ability of the learnable prompt for unseen classes. The key insight of KgCoOp is that the forgetting about essential knowledge can be alleviated by reducing the discrepancy between the learnable prompt and the hand-crafted prompt. Especially, KgCoOp minimizes the discrepancy between the textual embeddings generated by learned prompts and the hand-crafted prompts. Finally, adding the KgCoOp upon the contrastive loss can make a discriminative prompt for both seen and unseen tasks. Extensive evaluation of several benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed Knowledge-guided Context Optimization is an efficient method for prompt tuning, i.e., achieves better performance with less training time. code.","Title: Learning Domain-Aware Detection Head with Prompt Tuning
Abstract: Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained on an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain. However, existing methods focus on reducing the domain bias of the detection backbone by inferring a discriminative visual encoder, while ignoring the domain bias in the detection head. Inspired by the high generalization of vision-language models (VLMs), applying a VLM as the robust detection backbone following a domain-aware detection head is a reasonable way to learn the discriminative detector for each domain, rather than reducing the domain bias in traditional methods. To achieve the above issue, we thus propose a novel DAOD framework named Domain-Aware detection head with Prompt tuning (DA-Pro), which applies the learnable domain-adaptive prompt to generate the dynamic detection head for each domain. Formally, the domain-adaptive prompt consists of the domain-invariant tokens, domain-specific tokens, and the domain-related textual description along with the class label. Furthermore, two constraints between the source and target domains are applied to ensure that the domain-adaptive prompt can capture the domains-shared and domain-specific knowledge. A prompt ensemble strategy is also proposed to reduce the effect of prompt disturbance. Comprehensive experiments over multiple cross-domain adaptation tasks demonstrate that using the domain-adaptive prompt can produce an effectively domain-related detection head for boosting domain-adaptive object detection."
"Title: Generative Image Dynamics
Abstract: We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene dynamics. Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from real video sequences containing natural, oscillating motion such as trees, flowers, candles, and clothes blowing in the wind. Given a single image, our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a per-pixel long-term motion representation in the Fourier domain, which we call a neural stochastic motion texture. This representation can be converted into dense motion trajectories that span an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping dynamic videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in real pictures.","Title: DiffusioNeRF: Regularizing Neural Radiance Fields with Denoising Diffusion Models
Abstract: Under good conditions, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis tasks. NeRFs learn a scene's color and density fields by minimizing the photometric discrepancy between training views and differentiable renderings of the scene. Once trained from a sufficient set of views, NeRFs can generate novel views from arbitrary camera positions. However, the scene geometry and color fields are severely under-constrained, which can lead to artifacts, especially when trained with few input views. To alleviate this problem we learn a prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). Our DDM is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and can be used to predict the gradient of the logarithm of a joint probability distribution of color and depth patches. We show that, these gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors serve to regularize geom-etry and color of a scene. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered and the estimated gradient of the log-likelihood is backpropagated to the color and density fields. Evaluations on LLFF, the most relevant dataset, show that our learned prior achieves improved quality in the reconstructed geometry and improved generalization to novel views. Evaluations on DTU show improved Reconstruction quality among NeRF methods."
"Title: Blocks2World: Controlling Realistic Scenes with Editable Primitives
Abstract: We present Blocks2World, a novel method for 3D scene rendering and editing that leverages a two-step process: convex decomposition of images and conditioned synthesis. Our technique begins by extracting 3D parallelepipeds from various objects in a given scene using convex decomposition, thus obtaining a primitive representation of the scene. These primitives are then utilized to generate paired data through simple ray-traced depth maps. The next stage involves training a conditioned model that learns to generate images from the 2D-rendered convex primitives. This step establishes a direct mapping between the 3D model and its 2D representation, effectively learning the transition from a 3D model to an image. Once the model is fully trained, it offers remarkable control over the synthesis of novel and edited scenes. This is achieved by manipulating the primitives at test time, including translating or adding them, thereby enabling a highly customizable scene rendering process. Our method provides a fresh perspective on 3D scene rendering and editing, offering control and flexibility. It opens up new avenues for research and applications in the field, including authoring and data augmentation.","Title: LEGO-Net: Learning Regular Rearrangements of Objects in Rooms
Abstract: Humans universally dislike the task of cleaning up a messy room. If machines were to help us with this task, they must understand human criteria for regular arrangements, such as several types of symmetry, co-linearity or co-circularity, spacing uniformity in linear or circular patterns, and further inter-object relationships that relate to style and functionality. Previous approaches for this task relied on human input to explicitly specify goal state, or synthesized scenes from scratch - but such methods do not address the rearrangement of existing messy scenes without providing a goal state. In this paper, we present LEGO-Net, a data-driven transformer-based iterative method for LEarning reGular rearrangement of Objects in messy rooms. LEGO-Net is partly inspired by diffusion models - it starts with an initial messy state and iteratively “de-noises” the position and orientation of objects to a regular state while reducing distance traveled. Given randomly perturbed object positions and orientations in an existing dataset of professionally-arranged scenes, our method is trained to recover a regular rearrangement. Results demonstrate that our method is able to reliably rearrange room scenes and outperform other methods. We additionally propose a metric for evaluating regularity in room arrangements using number-theoretic machinery."
"Title: Breaking the Bank with ChatGPT: Few-Shot Text Classification for Finance
Abstract: We propose the use of conversational GPT models for easy and quick few-shot text classification in the financial domain using the Banking77 dataset. Our approach involves in-context learning with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which minimizes the technical expertise required and eliminates the need for expensive GPU computing while yielding quick and accurate results. Additionally, we fine-tune other pre-trained, masked language models with SetFit, a recent contrastive learning technique, to achieve state-of-the-art results both in full-data and few-shot settings. Our findings show that querying GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can outperform fine-tuned, non-generative models even with fewer examples. However, subscription fees associated with these solutions may be considered costly for small organizations. Lastly, we find that generative models perform better on the given task when shown representative samples selected by a human expert rather than when shown random ones. We conclude that a) our proposed methods offer a practical solution for few-shot tasks in datasets with limited label availability, and b) our state-of-the-art results can inspire future work in the area.","Title: Financial misstatement detection: a realistic evaluation
Abstract: In this work, we examine the evaluation process for the task of detecting financial reports with a high risk of containing a mis-statement. This task is often referred to, in the literature, as ""mis-statement detection in financial reports"". We provide an extensive review of the related literature. We propose a new, realistic evaluation framework for the task which, unlike a large part of the previous work: (a) focuses on the misstatement class and its rarity, (b) considers the dimension of time when splitting data into training and test and (c) considers the fact that misstatements can take a long time to detect. Most importantly, we show that the evaluation process significantly affects system performance, and we analyze the performance of different models and feature types in the new realistic framework."
